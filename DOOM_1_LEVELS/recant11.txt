Description             : RECANT is a fairly large level and is geared more
			  toward single play, although deathmatch and co-op are
			  of course supported. The water room took me forever
			  to put together, and the tower in the lava pit gave
			  me nightmares with the texture alignment (all done 
			  manually, folks<g>).  This was supposed to be a
			  much bigger level, actually (and may be someday),
			  but I'm worn thin and threadbare.  Still, there are
			  no loose ends here (I hope) -- and big levels, in
			  general, don't impress me.  They're a dime a dozen
			  these days.  

			  I love to get e-mail, so send me any comments you
			  like about RECANT (as long as they're in good
			  taste and full of obsequious high praise).

Instructions		: Put RECANT11.WAD in your HERETIC directory, type
			  "heretic -file recant.wad -warp 1 1 -skill <#>"
			  (Or, to play advanced, skill 4, also put the file
			  RECANT.BAT in your DOOM directory and type
			  RECANT.)

Modem Play		: Batch files for DIALing and ANSWERing are included
			  for your convenience, but you'll need to edit them
			  as far as phone numbers and com ports go.  Put
			  these in your HERETIC directory as well, and then
			  just type either "dial" or "answer."

Disclaimer		: I assume no responsibility for anything of any sort
			  in any way, shape, or form--now, then, henceforeward
			  in this life (or the next several) for any screw-ups
			  or even minor inconveniences this PWAD causes you,
			  your family, your relatives, friends, ancestors,
			  associates, employers, pets, neighbors, lovers,
			  congressional representatives, nor any other person--
			  living, dead, or undead -- that you have or will ever
			  have any contact with in even the slightest form.
			  This PWAD has been tested and tested ad infinitum, so
			  it shouldn't mess with your computer or anything else
			  remotely associated with it.  But if it DOES, then
			  that's the way the cookie crumbles. Don't come cryin'
			  to me.  It must be something YOU did.  If you don't
			  like it, lump it. (I ran out of clich‚s.)
