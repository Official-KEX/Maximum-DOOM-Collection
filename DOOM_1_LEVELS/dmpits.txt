DMPITS.ZIP CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING FILES:

        DMPITS.TXT (YOU'RE READING IT)
        DMPITS.BAT (STARTS PLAY)
        DMPITS.WAD (MODIFIED DOOM DATA FILE)

COPY DMPITS.BAT AND DMPITS.WAD INTO YOUR DOOM DIRECTORY. TYPE "DMPITS" TO
START PLAY. THERE IS NO SKILL LEVEL CHOICE - THEY'RE ALL THE SAME DIFFICULTY.

THIS PATCH FILE WILL NOT WORK IN THE SHAREWARE VERSION OF DOOM.

SPECIAL REQUEST 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THIS MODIFIED LEVEL IS THE RESULT OF 35+ HOURS OF EDITING AND TESTING. I HAVE
DONE MY BEST TO MAKE THIS LEVEL TOUGH YET "DOABLE."  I SURE HOPE YOU GIVE 
IT A FEW TRYS WITHOUT USING THE CHEAT KEYS. SAVING FREQUENTLY IS NOT A BAD
IDEA UNTIL YOU FIGURE OUT THE "TRICKS" OF THE FACILITY, BUT USING "GOD MODE"
WILL REALLY TAKE THE FUN OF THE MODIFICATIONS. I'M SURE MOST OF YOU WON'T 
HAVE ANY PROBLEMS AT ALL.

I DESIGNED THIS LEVEL WITH A VERY SPECIFIC MOVEMENT AND WEAPON SELECTION
STRATEGY. IF YOU FIND YOURSELF SAYING "THERE'S NO WAY ANYONE COULD BE FAST
ENOUGH TO SURVIVE THIS," THEN STEP BACK AND REEVALUATE YOUR APPROACH. DON'T
GIVE INTO THOSE CHEAT KEYS. ONCE YOU DISCOVER THE METHOD TO MY MADNESS YOU'LL
ONLY HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE RANDOM VARIABLES AND LOSING YOUR GRIP ON THE MOUSE
OR JOYSTICK <G>.  OF COURSE THERE ARE MANY AREAS WHERE YOU HAVE A WIDE 
SELECTION OF TACTICAL CHOICES, AND WHAT YOU DECIDE HERE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER
WALK OR CRAWL TO THE EXIT DOOR, OR END UP WITH CRITTERS DOING A JIG AROUND
YOUR CORPSE.

ON AVERAGE, IT TAKES ME 35 MINUTES TO COMPLETE THIS LEVEL. AND DESPITE MY
KNOWING EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS LEVEL, I STILL GET UP FROM MY COMPUTER SHAKING. 
I HOPE YOU HAVE AS MUCH FUN!

SINCE I REALLY ENJOYED DOING THIS AND WILL BE DOING MORE, I WOULD APPRECIATE 
ANY COMMENTS, CRITICISMS, OR SUGGESTIONS.  AND ALTHOUGH I DOUBT ANYONE WILL
NEED THEM, I WON'T MIND OFFERING SELECT "SUGGESTIONS" AND APPROACHES TO
SOLVING THIS LEVEL.

WARNING
~~~~~~~
USE OF THESE FILES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. I ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HAPPEN WHEN YOU USE THEM.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
THANKS TO THE FOLKS AT ID SOFTWARE FOR CREATING DOOM. IF ONLY ALL GAME
DESIGNERS/DEVELOPERS/PROGRAMMERS WERE SO GOOD AT WHAT THEY DO!

A VERY SPECIAL THANKS TO BRENDON WYBER AND RAPHAEL QUINET FOR CREATING THE
DOOM EDITING UTILITIES - A REALLY EXCELLENT PROGRAM WHICH MADE THIS 
MODIFICATION POSSIBLE.  SURE HOPE THEY ARE ABLE TO GET A FULL EDITOR
FIGURED OUT.
