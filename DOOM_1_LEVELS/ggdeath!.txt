Description             : The first 8 levels of this wad were created by me
                          with the intention of using them in deathmatch
                          mode with my buddies.  I did try to build them so
                          that they can be played in single mode, but I may 
                          have missed a few weapon stashes or monster dens
                          that should be toggled for multi-player only.

                          There is a definite trend in the complexity of the
                          levels from 1 to 8.  This reflects the fact that
                          I was just learning how to build wads at the first,
                          and slowly got the hang of it by the end.  Also, 
                          a modified E1M1 is included as the secret level, 
                          because my friends and I like that level best in
                          deathmatch mode.

                          The stat bar was based on one I found in the DOOM2
                          DOMAIN.WAD.  I lost the text file that came with
                          it, so apologies to the author.  The status bar face
                          was built by my friend B^2, and the new wall 
                          textures are modified floor textures saved as walls.
                          The new sky was something I generated in VistaPro, 
                          the menu lettering was generated in TrueSpace 3D 
                          Modeller (they didn't come out like I wanted, 
                          320x200 resolution sucks :<  ), and the new mission
                          names were simply cut and pasted from the existing
                          ones.

                          Phew! Well, I think that's it.  I hope you enjoy it.
                          Coincidentally, I also put together a pwad of new
                          sounds for use with my new levels.  It is called
                          GGSNDS!.WAD.  It is 1.6Meg, so I didn't include it
                          with this file.

Additional Credits to   : B^2 and the gang for play testing my new wads,
                          Thanks guys!
