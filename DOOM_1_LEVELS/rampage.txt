Description             :   Here's a nice, complete reconstruction of the
			 office where I work here in San Francisco.  Now
			 when I get mad I don't have to just sit around
			 and steam until I finally snap and go on a real
			 rampage -- I can do it at home!  And so can you!
			 Just pretend your co-workers and friends have been 
			 turned into evil creatures and it's easier to open
			 up on 'em!  Anyway, this wad is here so you can
			 vent your frustration in an air-conditioned and
			 target-rich environment.  It's especially good for
			 deathmatch , with lotsa nooks and crannies for 
			 your point-blank shotgun dueling enjoyment.  
			   I won't tell you where this office is because I
			 wouldn't feel safe knowing that there will be a lot
			 of people out there who can wipe the place out in
			 their sleep!  Enjoy!
