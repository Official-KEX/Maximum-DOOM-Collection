Description             : A indoor arena style DeathMatch level with 
                          a few surprises. ;)  Things get really
                          interesting at a certain point; not many
                          people can resist the temptation to flip 
                          that switch!
                          
Notes                   : Please let me know you're out there so I'll
                          feel like making more .WADs.  Any suggestions
                          or comments you have would be appreciated.
                          Also let me know if you're interested in Doom2
                          or Heretic versions of this level.

Additional Credits to   : My wife Brenda for putting up with
                          my 3am computer sessions.
