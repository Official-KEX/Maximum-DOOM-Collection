Email Address           : alan@cv3.chem.purdue.edu
Misc. Author Info       : Just a poor suffering graduate student
                          in chemistry.
Description             : A rather large pwad file that features a
                          large lake with some nasty surprises.
                          (WATCH YOUR BACK!!) There are no areas with
                          10 cyberdaemons, etc. and there is no weapon
                          more powerful than the rocket launcher.

Misc. Comments:

    This is my first pwad (how's that for a disclaimer).  I would greatly
    appreciate any comments that you might have (positive or flames).  If
    you would like to have this level modified for deathmath or cooperative 
    play, I will gladly do it.  (I have no one to play with/against)
    Your comments will determine whether I will spend any more time                            
    building wads.
