Description             : Ever play serial-link or otherwise more than
                          1 computer side by side in a doom deathmatch, and
                          just can't stand the other person looking at your
                          screen to see where your at?  Fool'em with this
                          mirror of E1M1.  They can tell where you are, but
                          not WHICH e1m1 your on.  There is more than 1
                          way to get to each e1m1, including some shortcuts.
