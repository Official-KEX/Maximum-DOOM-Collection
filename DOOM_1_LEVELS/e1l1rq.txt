This is a new E1M1 level, made with NewDEU 4.2.  Try it at "Ultra-Violence"...
It should work with the registered and shareware versions (I haven't tried
the latter - tell me if you tried it with a shareware version).

You don't know how to use this file?  It's easy:
	DOOM -FILE E1L1RQ.WAD
Have a nice DOOM!
