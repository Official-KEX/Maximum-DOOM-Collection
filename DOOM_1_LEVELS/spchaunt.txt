Description             : You have just found a derelict space ship orbiting
       	       	          a planet.  The crew is missing or has been
			  transformed; there are just zombies roaming all
			  parts of the ship--the bridge, the holosuite, the
			  transporter room, the engine rooms, and the empty
			  shuttle bay.  There are also various floating
			  creatures haunting the ship and outside in space.
			  A small shuttlecraft, also abandoned, is near the
			  ship.  On the planet, you find only unearthly
			  creatures stalking through abandoned ruins.  Thus
			  you get to battle in the vast reaches of outer space
			  and the sometimes cramped areas the ship.  There are
			  plenty of windows to shoot in and out of (you can
			  shoot through any of the windows but you can't shoot
			  through the transparent doors unless they are open.
			  An adequate supply of ammunition is scattered about
			  the ship and all of the weapons are available,
			  though you are going to have to *want* the rocket
			  launcher or the BFG9000.

Additional Credits to   : the unknown (to me) creator of SPACE.WAD for the
			  glass window texture;
			  Alberto Barsella (alberto@astrpi.difi.unipi.it) for
			  the transparent door idea;
			  my coworkers for the grueling playtesting and
			  helpful suggestions
