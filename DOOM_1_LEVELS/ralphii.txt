RalphIIb (r.wad) collected by Ralph (Hat Trick) Evans (revans@kaiwan.com)
This is an improved version of Ralphii & Ralphiia.  4 wads were replaced.
This is a deathmatch collection that replaces 30 levels in Doom2.
Levels 1-24, 26 & 28 were Doom 1 levels.  Level 26 was pretty well
reworked by Kevin Roels.  He also created Levels 27, 28 & 30 along
with the sounds & control panel replacement bar.

Play using "doom2 -file ralphii.wad".
