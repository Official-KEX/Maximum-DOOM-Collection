Description            : My first attempt at creating a level.  I said
                         level E1M2 could be a realy good deathmatch
                         level if you changed it around a bit.  So that
                         is exactly what I did.  Some good ideas and seems
                         like a good level for deathmatch.  We'll see.
                         I might decide to make more levels suitable for 
                         deatchmatch in the future, but none are in the
                         process of being made to this date.
