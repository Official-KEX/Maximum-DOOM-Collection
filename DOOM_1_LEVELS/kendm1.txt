Description             : PWAD file for E1M1.

                          Designed from the ground up for deathmatch.
                          Most actions/acquiring of a weapon cause
                          a sound so you generally know exactly where
                          other players are based on the sounds they're
                          making.

                          It's been played for (thousands of) hours
                          with two player deathmatch - it may be a bit
                          small for 4 player deathmatch.
