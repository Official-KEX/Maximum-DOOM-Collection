SPUNK.ZIP is a zipped PWAD-file, containing an entirely new map 
for level E1M1, made with DEU 5.0 ... I meant it especially for 
deathmatch-play; there's no exit, so you have to play till you drop! 
Especially -respawn is fun!

Do you have the SPUNK to play this?

Mail any suggestions or comments to: bl227@cleveland.freenet.edu

Happy DOOMing!

P.S.: I love those sergeants! Bring 'em on! Bring 'em on!
