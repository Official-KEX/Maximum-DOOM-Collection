Description             : Simple Death Match with small water passages that
                          lead up to a big clearing with erupting volcanos.
                          This is my first one so give me some feedback. You
                          can play cooperative, but its really only for Death-
                          match. I added the Player 1, 2, etc. so it wouldn't
                          bug up.
