Description             : These levels are designed especially for
                          deathmatch. They're great fun at even two
                          players games, but with a LOT of playtesting
                          we have found out that the more players you
                          have, the more fun :)

Note                    : We completely re-made level one, and finetuned
                          the others as well.
                          Also modified sounds and graphics, and
                          added a working extract.bat that you can
                          use to insert the sounds used in this
                          episode to doom.wad.

                          Jari Lanteri, for converting the music on
                          levels e1m3 and e1m9. And all the other
                          music authors, whose midi files we picked
                          out of a large midi-collection. We also
                          changed them a bit to make them sound better
                          on GUS. (Note: I don't have a gus and I don't
                          even intend to get one. Osku :))

Level-specific notes:

E1M4: There IS a way to exit on your own, but it's too hard for you to
figure out :) The first one to mail us a demo showing how he/she does it
gets his/her name on the next release of Halls of Death :)

Also, the first one to walk thru a certain doorway to a specific
direction gets teleported to a place where there is a lot of goodies
around. Including BFG. BUT, only one person can get there, and then it's
gone forever..

E1M2: The only weapons on medium/hard difficulty level are chaingun and
shotgun. At easy level, there's also a rocket launcher included.

E1M8: This level is actually a co-operative level, but we decided to
include it anyway :) You can still play it in deathmatch, though, it's
just not as good in deathmatch as in co-op.

E1M9: To exit press the button behind the plasma, and three areas (
secret lifts :)) will go down, and you must jump down with them to the
maze, where you will find the exit switch. )
