Misc. Author Info       : Parents wanted me to become an architect

Description             : An alteration of doom episode
                          one, mission two.  Rooms have been
                          added and joined to make for an excellent
                          deathmatch game.  Friends and I have spent
                          three hours straight on this one floor.
                          Plenty of places to sneak up on your friends,
                          or enemies depending on how you see it.
                          Its O.K. to sing "Roll out the barrel" at
                          the beginning of this game.

                          caution : do not play if you have a heart
                                    condition
