  To use this wad file, be sure to use the following command to load doom:

  DOOM -LOAD E1L5KO.WAD -DEVPARM -SKILL 4 -WART 1 5

  Be sure to use SKILL 4 (Ultraviolent) are you will be missing out on
  a couple of things.

  I made this level especially for deathmatch, but it is also a great game
  for cooperative mode.  Also, if you are like me, then this is a great 
  challenge for single play mode.

  Now about the lmp I included.  It shows that someone can win one this
  level by himself.  A little history about making it.  Finishing this
  level is hard, especially when under time constrant.  I tried many time
  to get the level finished under 15 minutes or so (seems to be the lmp
  time limit).  Finally I did so, but after looking at my inventory, I
  noticed that I didn't pick up the red card when I teleported.  Having
  nothing else I could do in 30 seconds, I blew myself up on purpose.  But
  since this was at the end of the level with a lot of ammo and health 
  everyone should realize that I could of finished it.  Lesson is to make
  sure you get the red key card when you teleport.  This was the first time
  I missed it, so you usually get it  when you teleport.

  To load the lmp type:

  doom -devparm -file e1l5ko.wad -skill 4 -playdemo e1l5ko
