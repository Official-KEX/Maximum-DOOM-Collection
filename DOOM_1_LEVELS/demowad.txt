DEMOWAD.WAD was thrown together using DoomCad 4.3 and DoomEd 4.2.
It's map E1M1 and it can only be made to work with registered IWADs with
the released version of WadWarp.

It uses textures and bits of maps from both Doom1 and Heretic.
To play this one, you will need to use Wadwarp to patch the Heretic textures
into the Doom Main Wad.  (See WADWARP.DOC)

If you want to play it under Heretic, run a map extract through DM1HER.DMX
and you'll get the same level with Heretic Monsters.
