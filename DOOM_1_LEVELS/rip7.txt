Description             : Another deathmatch-only board, this one is a
                          good bit bigger than some of the others.  More-less
                          it was a bunch of small ideas put into one.  
                          You have a BIG lift on the far left side of the
                          board, a maze in the center (can you figure out
                          how to get on the ledges?), and a rocket pit
                          on the bottom.  Frag 'em!
