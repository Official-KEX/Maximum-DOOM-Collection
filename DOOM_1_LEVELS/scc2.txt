Description:
                SoftChoice II WAD is the second "release" of the
                modified floorplan of Softchoice Corp located in Toronto,
                Ontario, Canada. The board is designed for Deathmatch
                play as no mere mortal would be able to survive this
                board playing by themselves without cheats... (Go ahead!
                Try me!!!)

Stipulations:
                You may not change or modify this level and re-release them
                into the public domain without first asking myself...

                Have fun...
