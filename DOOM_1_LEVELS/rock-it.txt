        Welcome to Rock-it.wad, the second edit of Rocket.wad. Like the 

first, it is a big, fast, obnoxious, deathmatch map, intended to be used

WITH THE FEW MONSTERS IT CONTAINS, which slots into the E1M1 position.  

                        
                        ***CAUTION*** 

        If you are looking for a solo game, then this is NOT the wad 

to play, since you will probably find it exceedingly dull. On the other 

hand, if you are looking for a map created by a deranged Bio major in his 

not-so-spare time, geared towards large-scale slaughter, then this *just* 

might work.

        I would greatly appreciate any *constructive* comments/suggestions

which you might have (see e-mail below).

        Enjoy :)
