Description             : Note!!! This level is for deathmatch only.
                          Your mission is to take over all three
                          main buildings, and kill every other
                          military personel.
                          Unfortunately all the other commandos
                          have the same intructions.
                          Commando mission 1 is very tight and
                          compact wad map. And it has plenty of
                          action even with -nomonsters parameter
                          There are no secret or hidden places,
                          and all weapons are available. But
                          remember, there are only one way to
                          restore your health, a single supercharge
                          in the middle of central square.
