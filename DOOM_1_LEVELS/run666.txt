Description			: A hunting deathmatch / single player wad, designed (deathmatch) 
				  to encourage chasing  your opponent, while posing the risk that 
				  he/she may turn the tables on you if you aren't careful. 
				  Single player requires a little thought, hopefully not to little
			                thougth, and there are no nasty tricks or unsolvable traps.  
				  This wad designed for use under version 1.666. Has fair ammount 
				  of ammo,  so you may or may not want to use -altdeath for 						  respawning.  Difficulty levels fully implemented.
