Fortnew.wad is an example of what the registered version of the
object placer can do.

FORTNEW.WAD contains the same map and is based on FORTRESS.WAD which 
can be found on the D!ZONE disk.  Just to prove to the skeptical that
the generator can handle large WADS and the placement of hundreds of 
objects.

The machine I used wad a 486BL75 with only 458KB of free memory, my network
software hogs memory, you don't need much memory to use the generator.
It took about 45 seconds to generate, then I played the level. 

I issued the following command at the dos prompt:

DMOP.EXE datrwop1.dat e:\levels\pwads\fortress.wad gzero.rw fortnew.wad E1M1 E1M1 100P 45936

E: is my cdrom drive.

I played through FORTNEW and enjoyed it, you have to get the weapons
and health before you try to get the BLUE key.  The maze is filled with
monsters that will sneak up on you.

Keep in mind while you play Fortnew that you can redo all your 
DOOM patchwads or original levels with my generator and have a fresh
DOOM everyday.

To load FORTNEW copy FORTNEW.WAD to your DOOM 1 directory and type:

DOOM -FILE FORTNEW.WAD

Have fun!
