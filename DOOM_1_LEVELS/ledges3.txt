Description             : This patch file is for E1M1. This is the
                          next DEATHMATCH WAD in the LEDGES series.
                          Improved placement of weapons and items to
                          insure optimum "fragging". This level is
                          designed primarily for DEATHMATCH. 

Additional Credits to   : Steve Burg, Douglas Hay, Bill Nowicki, 
                          Phil Katz

Additional Notes        : If you have any suggestions or ideas, please
                          email, Im always looking for new ideas for
                          the ledges episodes.

                          Hopefully, when the LEDGES series is completed
                          you will be able to have 9 LEDGES episodes that
                          will allow you to play from LEDGE to LEDGE and
                          have hours of fun. At least, thats my goal. :)
