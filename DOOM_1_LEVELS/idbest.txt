Misc. Author Info       : I live in Minneapolis.  Let me know if you want
                          a deathmatch.

Description             : This a huge deathmatch level made by cutting and
                          pasting together parts of e1m1, e1m2, e1m3, e1m4,
                          and e1m5.  It's intended for regular deathmatch,
                          and there are no energy weapons.  I added a lot
                          more to idmix.wad, and I redid the layout a bit.
                          Idmix.wad was hastily thrown together.  Now the
                          the ceiling and floor tiles are properly aligned
                          (at least where it counts) and the exit works :).
