	I just posted a new deathmatch level to infant.  It is based on 
the idea that a good deathmatch level should not let anyone have a big 
advantage while playing, and that you shouldn't be able to frag yourself.
This room is a small square with a few moving pillars and a transporter 
in the center of the room.  I got the idea from paintball, where the two 
opposing teams play in a small arena with little cover and no advantages.
The name of the game is Speed Ball, or in this case Speed DOOM.

Title                   : SPEEDOOM.WAD
Author                  : Thomas Blackman (Faceman)

Description             : This is a small (3K) deathmatch wad that  
			  allows no-one to have a distinct advantage
			  when playing.
			 
Additional Credits to   : Jay and Hanover for testing it with me.
