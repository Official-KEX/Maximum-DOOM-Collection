Description:    The ultimate deathmatch.

		This level is specifically designed for DEATHMATCH play.
		It comprises 4 zones: the ATRIUM (centre); JSH ZONE (East);
		ARENA (West); and the WARP ZONE (North). There are also two
		SECRET ROOMS.

		Each zone has its own theme, strategy and secrets. Note
		that the skill levels (1-5) also have a major effect on
		the strategies.

		MEGADETH is designed to be played with monsters present.

		MEGADETH incorporates the use of enhanced weapons.
		



Story:          After defeating the Demons in Hell on Earth, you finally
		discover the truth of DOOM. The original invasion of the
		Phobos moonbase by the hordes from Hell was only possible
		because of a human traitor - an officer in the Space
		Marines like you. You have tracked him down after
		discovering his picture in the ARENA, and now one thought
		is foremost in your mind - to scatter his atoms to the
		depths of hell!

		This will be your toughest mission yet - an assassination
		- and you will have Earth's most advanced weaponry
		available to you: guns with laser sights and silencers!

		Earth is counting on you. The final War of the Worlds is
		about to begin on Mars - Earth vs. Hell - prepare for
		M E G A D E T H . . .




Gameplay:       MEGADETH is designed solely for deathmatches although all
		other modes are supported. It is a highly strategic level
		designed first and foremost for depth of gameplay. This
		level rewards the strategic player who takes the trouble
		to learn its secrets.



Enhanced
Weapons:        MEGADETH is an assassination mission and therefore gives
		you access to enhanced weapons. These incorporate silencers
		for the pistol and chaingun, and laser sights for the
		pistol, shotgun and chaingun. (Laser sights are optional.)

		The silencers only muffle the shots enough for you to hit
		your target without him hearing you  :)

		The shotgun and plasma rifle have enhanced sounds.

		The laser sights are not used for the rocket launcher,
		plasma rifle and BFG9000 because these weapons have a blast
		radius and do not need precise aiming.

		The laser sights will auto-dim when you enter darkened areas
		to avoid giving your position away  :))

		Like with the real thing, if you keep the trigger down on
		the pistol, shots will tend to wander after the first one.
		It is best to release the trigger after each shot. This also
		applies to the chaingun. Short controlled bursts of fire are
		most effective.

* Instructions *        To activate the LASER SIGHTS, type "LASERON" at
			the DOS prompt. This will work for all Doom levels.
			To switch the laser sights off, type "LASEROFF" at
			the DOS prompt.

			To try out the level in single player mode, type
			"DOOM -FILE MEGADETH.WAD" at the DOS prompt. Then
			start your game as normal. When you enter a level,
			type "IDCLEV27".





* Play Guide *
			This WAD should not be judged by playing it in
			single player or cooperative modes, but if you
			insist on playing it this way then try skill
			level 4. On Deathmatch, for an action oriented
			"kill everything that moves" game try skill
			level 1. For a more strategic game try skill
			level 3 (recommended).

			The WARP ZONE is not designed as a combat zone
			and is best used as a means of access to weapons
			and power-ups.

			The level is designed so that if you listen to
			the monsters and warp sounds you can judge where
			your opponent is.

+ Secrets *             WARNING - reading the following may significantly
			enhance your enjoyment of this level :)

	ATRIUM:         The ATRIUM has two lifts, operated by pushing one
			wall on each lift. It also has a secret warp which
			teleports to the top of a pillar sniper position.
			The small building has a fake front wall which is
			ideal for snipers. There are 2 hidden doors leading
			to the JSH ZONE, 2 hidden doors leading to the ARENA
			and one large hidden door leading to the WARP ZONE.

			One lift is an octagon located in the NE corner. Its
			NE wall is the switch. The other lift is a rectangle
			located in the SE corner. Its S wall is the switch.

			The warp leading to the top of the pillar (and the
			BFG9000) is located at the E end of the large block
			(facing the door to the WARP ZONE) at the North. The
			only way to enter the warp is to enter it by moving
			Southwards. (The approximate location of the warp is
			at the NE of the ATRIUM.)

	JSH ZONE:       The JSH ZONE has 2 fake walls which are ideal for
			snipers and one hidden teleport (the end wall in
			the "S").

	ARENA:          The ARENA has many secrets. It has two lifts,
			operated by pushing 2 of the angled sides. It has
			a cyberdemon trapped by barrels (it is not a good
			idea to let a stray shot hit a barrel!), and a
			spider demon trapped with some of his buddies from
			hell (don't get too close). There are two exits (one
			to the Tower of Babel and the other to the Fortress
			of Mystery). There is also a fake wall with a sniper
			position and a secret tunnel leading from it. The
			switch in this area raises the Spider Demon and the
			warp platforms. Its generally not a good idea to use
			it. There are four marked warp platforms.

			The two lifts are located at the NE and SW corners
			of the ARENA. Each has two walls which act as
			switches. For the NE lift these are the angled NW
			and NE faces. For the SW lift these are the angled
			SW and SE faces.

	WARP ZONE:      The WARP ZONE has a central area packed with
			weapons, ammunition, medikits and power-ups. To get
			to it you must follow the path created by the
			barrels. The monsters are deaf here and will not
			bother you so long as you don't start the fight!
			Also, a stray bullet will destroy the barrel path
			and you will keep warping if you try to reach the
			goodies. Some warp points take you out of the WARP
			ZONE itself. Two hidden warp points (South & East)
			provide access to the two secret rooms.

			As players were finding it frustrating trying to
			navigate the path after the barrels were destroyed,
			I have provided a faint visual path on the floor
			which can be used as a guide. The entrance to the
			path is on the East side of the WARP ZONE. The faint
			path is most visible with low levels of gamma
			correction. However, before resorting to this,
			players can follow the temporary energy cell path.
			There is also a short-cut route.

			The warp leading to SECRET ROOM 1 is located mid-way
			in the South of the WARP ZONE. It is the SW line of
			the faint upside down V in the South. Access it by
			moving North or NW.

			The warp leading to SECRET ROOM 2 is located mid-way
			in the East of the WARP ZONE. It is located to the
			West of the soldier on the pole. Access it by moving
			just South of the soldier and then moving West (about
			300 degrees).

	SECRET ROOM 1:  SECRET ROOM 1 is full of weapons and ammunition. The
			floor is made of lava and inflicts a small amount of
			damage (this prevents players hiding here). The warp
			exit leads to three different locations.

	SECRET ROOM 2:  SECRET ROOM 2 is full of body armour and power-ups.
			This room is radioactive and inflicts a small amount
			damage (this prevents players hiding here). The warp
			exit leads to three different locations.


================================================================


	MEGADETH has been extensively play tested and should contain
	no bugs. If you do find a bug, let me know so I can fix it.

	A lot of effort has gone into MEGADETH and I would greatly
	appreciate it if people let me know what they think - good
	or bad. If there is enough demand I may write an update
	featuring players' comments, or maybe even version 3.


	* Remember - your feedback is greatly appreciated *
