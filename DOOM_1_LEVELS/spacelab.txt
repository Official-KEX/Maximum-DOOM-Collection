Description             : This is a DEATHMATCH 2.0 pwad.
                          Please play this wad with -altdeath only.
                          You will lack the necessary ammo with origional 
                          deathmatch rules.  All weapons are accessable and 
                          a COOPERATIVE exit is included.
                          Monsters: CYBE! Just to keep you on the move.
                          Plus, a couple of barons for you to wave at as you 
                          go by!  For BEST results, Play ultra-violence with
			  respawn switched ON! 
                          
Info                    : Being an advid Doom player since Dec. 10th '93,
			  I had to finally create a PWAD of my own.  Just 
                          could not take the dreams...running through the 
                          corridors! :)
                          This is my first Deathmatch pwad.
                          The level is very compact, so you
                          won't search to long to get a frag.
                          
                                                                                       
Additional Credits to   : Brendon Wyber and Raphael Quinet for DEU.
