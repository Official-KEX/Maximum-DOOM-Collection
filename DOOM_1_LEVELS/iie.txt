Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
You have to be brave to enter IIE.
What you will discover inside could afraid you, you're warned !

IIE means (in French) : Institut d'Informatique d'Entreprise
what can be translated by : Institute of Computer Science for Firms

When I entered IIE, I thought at once : "This would make a great level 
for DOOM". Thus, the architecture is so strange and the map is so big
that I did not resist making this level. It took me an impressive amount
of hours but I am happy about the result.

There are 2 floors in the level : the first floor (where you begin) 
and the ground floor where you go through 2 stairways : one is normal, 
the other one is a spiral staircase. The link between the two parts of 
each stairway is a teleport (the only way I found to simulate it). 
So don't be afraid if you teleport at the middle of the stairs !

You will also notice 3 stairs which would like to lead you to the next
floor up. Misfortunately, this floor is not complete yet. I am working
on it and will add it to the next version of IIE (IIE ][ ?).

All weapons are present in the level, except BFG9000. You will find them 
in due time (yet they won't fall from the sky : search them all the same !).
An indication : you will have to run fast to get the chaingun ...

How to play ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To play IIE, just launch IIE.BAT.  (You had guessed ? You're strong !)
Then see the demo or play.
YOU CAN CHOOSE THE SKILL YOU WANT : IT WILL BE HELL ANYWAY !
In fact I think this level is not too hard for good players (especially
if you are a mouse-player). If it is really too easy for you, tell me
I will add monsters (or do it yourself !).

>Note< The demo shows nothing, you can see it without fear.

PLAY TO THE END : THERE ARE SURPRISES !
AND TRY TO DISCOVER ALL SECRETS (5) !

Have fun !

To finish
~~~~~~~~~
Get DEATHEB.WAD, a good deatmatch level !

If you own a Gravis Ultrasound with 1024K on board, get GUS1M-II.WAD, 
your ears will be amazed. 
If you don't, what a pity for you !
