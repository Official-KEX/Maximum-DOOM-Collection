Misc. Author Info		: I'm SYSADMIN and SYSPGMR for supercomputing
				  with no time on my hands, but make time for
				  the most important thing: DOOM!

Description			: A deathmatch level, designed originally for 
				  2 player modem, but suitable for 3-4 player network and
				  single player. This started as my first wad, but went through
				  many hours of reworking to look good. Anyway, the central 
				  area of this level is a reasonable representation of where I and
				  my regular deathmatch oponnent work in real life, with a DOOM
				  twist, of course. Outside areas and such were added just for fun.
				  We find this a constant favorite for long deathmatch duels, but 
				  that may be due to our familiarity with the layout. Hope you find 
				  it as much fun. Little attention payed to monsters / difficulty levels,
				  best played with -nomonsters. Please don't flame me about the 
				  bigdoor2 textures on most doors, I used the texture because I hate 
				  the other available door textures for less that 128 widths. 
				  This wad designed for use under version 1.666. Has lots of ammo,
				  so you may or may not want to use -altdeath for respawning. 
				  Then again, if you like rocket duels, you might.
