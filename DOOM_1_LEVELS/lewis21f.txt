ALL:

I'm sure some of you have seen the earlier incarnations of my wad
(lewis21b and lewis21e). This is the txt file for the newest version
of the wad. First, the template:
================================================================
Title                   : lewis21f.wad

Misc. Author Info       : 

Description             : My wad is a huge canyon with 3 mountains, various
			  caves and tunnel complexes, spiral stair cases,
			  a teleport grid, traps, and really long, scenic
			  views! Ideal for solo play or deathmatch (lots of
			  hidden nooks and crannies, and plenty of room to
			  run around). I think its fairly easy, even on UV,
			  but I didn't make it too hard. I wanted it to be
			  fun. And so it is! Enjoy!

Additional Credits to   : Deviant on IRC, for suggesting that I remove a few
			  trees to make his 486 stop slowing down. :)

Other: -Most recent modifications were to remove a few extraneous trees, to
        make a FEW of the dark areas lighter, and to make a couple of rooms
        darker ... don't whine, its just 2 rooms. Open the door and back up
        into the safe, lit area you cowards. Besides, its not THAT dark. :)
       -I have included a lmp file and a batch file to view the lmp with.
        Watch the LMP only AFTER you play the level or some surprises might be
        ruined (I want the weak among you to jump a couple of times). I kill
        everything eventually, and I grab all the keys, get almost all the
        items, activate practically every teleporter, go to all 3 areas
        beyond the teleport grid, etc. Just to show ya how its done. I move
        kinda fast thru the teleport grid, but you'll get it. Any my apologies
        for my playing. :) Its on UViolence. I only just woke up, so I miss
        a lot and played very hastily and casually and without concern for
        deadliness or accuracy. I basically slob through the level and do
        everything. :) Enjoy.
