Misc. Author Info       : Slowly, painfully dying in architecture..

Description             : PWAD file for E1M1.

                          Again, designed from the ground up for deathmatch
                          only. This is a bit smaller than the last and
                          tends to be 'frag happy.' Again, mostly everything
                          you do will cause some sort of noise to alert the
                          other player as to exactly where you are. Be
                          careful and have fun with the rockets.. :)

                          Again, probably too small for anymore than 2
                          deathmatch players.
