Misc. Author Info       : I spend WAY too much time doing this.

Description             : This is another in the arena-like series
                          of my wads.  (There are now 3 and more on
                          the way.)  Markroom3 is becoming my favorite.
                          The wad is one room, but it has many sub-parts.
                          The 2 main parts are the Stair Sections and the 
                          Floor Sections.  The Stairs are elevated above
                          the Floor sections and contain mostly ammo and
                          armor.  The Floor sections contain the weapons
                          and the teleport Ladder.  The Ladder can be used
                          to traverse the room instead of the Stair sections.
                          There is a Green Ladder which runs north and a
                          Blue Ladder that runs south.  Remember this.
                          The Ladder can create some great teleporter races.  \
                          Now, since you're probably confused and don't know 
                          what the hell I'm talking about.... 
                          Play the damn level and see for yourself!

                          It's visually appealing in itself, but I think 
                          you'll find this to be a challenging level for
                          even the best doom-gods.  Plenty of good hiding
                          places and plenty of good hunting ground.
                          
                          There is a non-coop exit located in the SE corner.
                          It's not obviously labelled... sorry.  It's the
                          only switch on the whole level.
