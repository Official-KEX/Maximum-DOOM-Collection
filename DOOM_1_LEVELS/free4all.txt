Misc. Author Info       : Crazed and devoted DOOM nut in search of the
                          "perfect" four player deathmatch WAD. Spends more
                          time doing DOOM related things (writing DOOMLoad,
                          making WAD's, reading alt.games.doom) than would
                          like to admit. Thanx to my ever loving significant
                          other for understanding this crazy obsession of
                          mine (and for not spending more time with her
                          after work... :) )
Description             : In the spirit of LEDGES comes this all out
                          deathmatch slugfest. All weapons are present, but
                          are situated in such a place that going for them,
                          puts the player at a perfect position to be
                          fragged by other players. GET THE WEAPONS AND RUN!
                          ALOT of time has been spent figuring out the
                          layout to be in such a way that it makes for a FAST
                          paced game and there are minimal "skulking" 
                          positions. Don't stand around! You'll get fragged!
                          The exit requires two people to complete the board.
                          One person to press a switch, and another person to
                          use the lift. I've added a half-dozen imps around 
                          the board for a bit of variety but you may wish to
                          use -nomonsters, or for real fun, use -respawn.
                          HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR -altdeath PLAY!!!

                          (Did I forget to mention that you start off with                          
                          the chainsaw and shotgun... :)

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor(s) used          : DEU v5.21, id's DOS port of BSP
Known Bugs              : One of the warps is misaligned! Damn 64 pixel
                          blocks... (More work than it's worth...)
Design Time             : Too much to recall, I'd guess at about 50+ hours
                          after figuring out how to get my keyboard to work
                          with the GUS.

* Misc. Notes *

 I'm a bit disapointed with the end result of the music on the GUS. It maps
 the instruments differently than how I originally had composed it, but all
 that aside, I hope it's good enough deathmatch mood music :)
