Title                   : Grease.  Just because.

Description             : This is intended FOR DEATHMATCH ONLY.
                          Other people can play it, but I dunno
                          why you'd want to.  Don't ask me why I
                          made this - I have no way of actually
                          deathmatching with anyone myself :(  I
                          would still appreciate any feedback.
                          I basically came up with the idea and
                          made it in about an hour.  The idea is
                          to have some fast paced action without
                          suicide holes for wimps.  All weapons
                          save BFG are here, but you have to travel
                          to get them.  Take a look, anyways.
