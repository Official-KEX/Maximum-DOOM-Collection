Combat.wad is a package of 3 wads a created a while ago when deu5.0
first came out.  They're all pretty simple wads - basically the standard,
"You're in a big room with a lot of monsters. Go kill."   Nonetheless,
I think they can be a lot of fun.  Also, they're very good for developing
and practicing good DOOM combat skills.

I'd advise starting on 'Hurt Me Plenty' or even 'Not Too Rough'.
Ultra Violence is pretty nasty, and I don't even want to imagine what
playing these on 'Nightmare' would be like.

OK, so you're getting roughed up mercilessly, and you want to know 
how to survive.

On E1M1, it's you and your fist vs. Demons.  My advice: don't use
the chainsaw (unless you enjoy getting surrounded and crushed).
Instead, use the berserk packs.  Then run around the demons in circles,
occasionally striking at the lead demon chasing you. The shift (run)
key is vital here.

E1M2: Without armor, you're dead meat. So, the first thing you need to
do is get some.  A suit of green armor is in the northern corridor
of the first chamber.  At the start, run North as fast as you can!
After you get the armor, keep moving, picking off monsters when
you get the chance.
In the second chamber, let the sargents and imps kill each other.  Just
keep running up and down the hall until nothing is left but the Baron.
Then go fight him.

E1M3: For people who know how to fight cyberdemons, this is actually
the easiest of the three.  Just remember that when you get surrounded
by hordes of spectres, you can blast your way out - BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE
RUNNING!  Not using the shift key is a sure way to die.
Also, don't forget to get the blue armor at the start.
