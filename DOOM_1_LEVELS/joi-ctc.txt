Description             : Note!!! This level is for deathmatch only.
                          Commando training camp is very tight and
                          compact wad map. There are many one sided walls
                          (for neat ambush places), high walls to walk on
                          and narrow underground passages to crawl. But
                          remember, just when you think you found the
                          perfect ambush place, someone else shoots you
                          from the back. There are many ways to get in one
                          place in case someone blocks the other way. All
                          the weapons are available, yes the plasmagun and
                          BFG9000 are possible to get. If you think you
                          get stuck in the balcony, try pushing the
                          railing. Try pushing everywhere to find out
                          extra goodies. There are few secret teleports
                          for quick transport. Although this is rather
                          small map, as deathmatch levels should be, it
                          requires fast machine to run smoothly. This map
                          includes special autotimer feature which
                          automaticly sets limit for playing time. Timer
                          is one deathmatch starting point, where are
                          stairs to exit button. All stairs are teleports
                          to back to game, but they work only once, so
                          after all stairs have been used the only way out
                          is exit button.

Authors may NOT use this level as a base to build additional
levels. I am sick and tired to play the same maps with only
different names and one big monster added to original map.
However, you are welcome to use autotimer feature if needed
but leave some credits for me in your wad text.
