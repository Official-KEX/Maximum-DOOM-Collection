Description             : Pretty much a straightforward deathmatch level.
                          Not really a whole lot to it, some dark rooms which
                          is where you will find most of the guns.  Shells
                          are scattered everywhere, so you will not run out
                          of them.  All weapons visible.  Designed for
                          deathmatch, and pretty much covers the purpose
                          rather well.  You can run though with 1 player
                          to check out the level if you want.
