Description             : The government boasts that Outpost 21 is the home
			  of scientific research that will benefit all 
			  humanity.  On the surface, Outpost 21 appears
			  to be a peaceful complex that provides its
			  small team of dedicated scientists with living
			  quarters, research labs, and recreational
			  facilities.  However, not even the aliens
			  who recently inhabited Outpost 21 were aware 
			  of the dark and dirty secrets that lie beneath .

Additional Comments	:

   As with any Doom level, please play this level in a dimly lit
   or dark room.  I strongly urge that you not use gamma correction
   unless you really have an unusually dark monitor.  Gamma correction
   tends to put a "wash" on the otherwise deep Doom colors and I
   have chosen the light levels carefully.  Some parts of this
   level are dimly lit.  This is not to disorient the player or
   pull a cheap shot in the dark.  It is to create the proper
   mood and to exploit certain Doom textures that would look
   unconvincing in brighter light (and with gamma correction).
   Have fun!
