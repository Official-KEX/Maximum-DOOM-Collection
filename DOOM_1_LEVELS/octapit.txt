Misc. Author Info       : This is my first wad -- hope you all like it!

Description             : I made this wad first as a deathmatch
                          wad and then decided to add some monsters
                          to the mahem.  Basically there's a central
                          octagonal room with raised surounding
                          platforms.  A couple of side rooms accessed
                          via teleporters with one taking inspiration
                          from Indiana Jones, The Last Crusade.  :)
