Description             :Welcome to the Pleasure Dome!  This is where all of
			the posessed soldiers and sargents come to watch
			those marines die who will not succumb to posession
			by the demons infesting the world.  This level is
			like the Roman Coloseums of old, except that you are
			the poor slob about to be fed to the beasts.  
			  They do give you a shotgun to try to duke it out
			with, but they don't expect you to last long.  They
			just hope that your death will be entertaining.

Notes			:The level has been designed so you can play it
			in single player, multiplayer, and deathmatch.
			Deathmatch is especially good because everything is
			interconnected and there are several good sniper
			spots.  I have not included any big nasties (such
			as the Cyber-Demon or Spider-Demon), but this would
			make a perfect setting for them if you want to modify
			the level.
			  I spent a lot of time trying to make the level look
			good, so tell me if you find something that makes you
			just puke.  I also only used natural light everywhere.
			There are only 2 dark areas, but you never fight in
			those areas -- just collect goodies.  I even put in
			some light-amp goggels in those areas.
			  The only time you will appreciate these things is
			when the level is empty because you don't have time
			to sit and enjoy the scenery.

You may do whatever you want with this wad, just give me some credit for
building the base level.  I would be interested in how people modify this
level. Drop me a line.
