flash.wad

A WAD file for DOOM 1.2 [reg]

This is my first attempt at a big WAD file. I used mine1.wad as the basis
for the map, changed a few linedefs and added a big section onto it. It's
totally populated, and the four difficulty levels are active. It's also
been set up for cooperative gaming. The level is ideal for deathmatches, as
there are lots of rooms and windows and nooks and crannies to hide out in
(good for a three on one!), but it might be a little hairy at the
ultraviolence level. I've spent three days testing the hell out of it, so
it should be bulletproof. As far as I know you won't get a single "hall of
mirrors" effect anywhere on the map.

The only glitch I've come across is the secrets tally. There *is* a secret
room on this level, but if you find it the end-tally still shows 0%. If you
know how to fix this, drop me a line.

I'm currently working on a truly massive and intricate level, but I'm also
putting together a small one here and there. If you enjoy flash.wad, please
send me email and tell me what you like about it. If there's something you
*don't* like, tell me that too.

Happy Fragging!
