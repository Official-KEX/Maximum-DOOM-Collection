Misc. Author Info       : This is our first WAD, but it is
                          bigger and more complex than most
                          people's first attempts. (146k).

Description             : This is the first level in a new
                          9 level episode.  A run through
                          the muck.

Note                    : For those who are unfamiliar with
                          using PWADs, just unzip this into
                          your Doom directory and type GO.
