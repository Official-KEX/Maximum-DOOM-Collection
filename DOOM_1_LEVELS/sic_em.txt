Description             : An experts' DEATHMATCH WAD.  For those who
                          demand the best fraggin they can get.  
                          Oh, it's pretty to look at, as well.

                          I designed this for my friends and me who,
                          are becoming quite good at killing each
                          other.  I don't recommend this WAD for
                          groups who are not closely matched or for
                          beginers.  If, however, you and your friends
                          are looking for a great place to show off
                          your skill, here it is.

                          As in my previous levels everyone starts 
                          with either the shotgun or chaingun.
                          A new twist is the ready rooms where you 
                          pick up your weapon and some ammo before
                          teleporting into the fray.  The rocket 
                          launcher, the plasma rifle and the BFG all
                          require some effort to achieve.  If you 
                          try for the BFG or the power globe (hit
                          the two switches in the middle) more often
                          then not someone else will get to them 
                          before you do.  This definitely a "more
                          the merrier" type of WAD.  Not big but,
                          a definite slugfest with three or four
                          players.

                          There is a co-op exit in the SE corner.
                          the switch in the NW opens it.

                          As a note to other level editors: I believe
                          I have achieved the most visplanes in view
                          possible with out crashing the game.  In 
                          fact if you look at the NE and SW corners
                          you'll see where I had to cut the corner
                          to keep a player from getting back far
                          enough to see a part of the ceiling. If you
                          clip backwards from there the game will
                          crash.

                          Please enjoy this WAD and share it with
                          others.
