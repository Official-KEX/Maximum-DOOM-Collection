 At first, I didn't notice all the textures misaligned and monsters too close
 to the walls in Rambutt3.wad. I didn't notice'em until after I had released
 the wad itself ! So, here's take #2, hopefully bug free. (?)

 If you the name of the wad that any of these levels came from or who created
 them, drop me a line ! I want to credit to the people who did these !

 Also, I've added multi-player starts to all of these levels (deathmatch
 included !) and I also fixed some problems that I found, as well as fixing
 some problems that I added! So, if any of these levels are yours, I hope you 
 like what I did to them.

 The secret exit is in the same place it was in Rambutt1.wad. Where's that ?
 Let's just say, don't go sneaking around in your parent's room !!
