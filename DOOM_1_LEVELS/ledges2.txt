Description             : This patch file is for E1M1. This is the
                          sequal to LEDGES.WAD. It is basically the
                          same as LEDGES.WAD, but it has a different
                          layout, and some new tricks to get the
                          weapons. Again, the level is designed for
                          deathmatch play, and doesnt function well 
                          under normal or co-operative mode.
                          The plasma rifle is nicely placed and should
                          cause havoc in your first few matches.

                          email, Im always looking for new ideas for
                          the ledges episodes.
