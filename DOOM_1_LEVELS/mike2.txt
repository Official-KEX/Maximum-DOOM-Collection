Description             : This level is designed for DEATHMATCH play.
                          It's a modified E1m1 with some new perks. Look
         	   	  for the chainsaw on the elevator, and some new
			  exits/entrances to the rocket area. As well the
			  slime pits don't cause you damage any longer,
			  and dark areas have been added for added suspense.
                          
Misc game info          : Deathmatch Heaven - Also an extra shotgun, you'll
			  see it.
