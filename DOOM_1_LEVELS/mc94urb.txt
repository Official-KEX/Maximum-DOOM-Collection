Description             : A deathmatch level originally developed as
                          the official arena for the 1st Italian Doom
                          Championship (Urbino, September 11-25, 1994),
                          sponsored by MCmicrocomputer, the leading italian
                          microcomputer magazine. (That explains
                          its name and the presence of the MC logo
                          in the central hoctagonal hall).
                          The level is quite wide, very symmetrical,
                          with 3 rings of long corridors which
                          surround a central "plaza". 4 carefully designed
                          special entry points ensure the optimal
                          deployment of players. All the major weapons
                          are present, as well as some healing potions,
                          lots of barrels and a few monsters.
                          Some nice tricks are played with switches,
                          lifts and lights (in certain areas the presence
                          of the light or the lowering of a floor is an
                          useful warning against a potential ambush).
                          The level is designed to be played by no less
                          than 4 players, and with the deathmatch 2.0 rules.
                          An exit switch (very hidden) is supplied; however,
                          the level is to be played on a fixed time base as
                          enforced by the -timer # command line switch (only
                          in Doom v. 1.666). The suggested time base (adopted
                          in the Italian Championship) is 25 minutes.
