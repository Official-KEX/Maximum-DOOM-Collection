MAVERICK - A DOOM Level for Deathmatch Play
===========================================

Replaces E2M1.  Uses existing graphics.

----------

I recently asked DOOM players what they liked in a Deathmatch level.
A lot of people made suggestions.  After listening and thinking, I have
designed a Deathmatch level that should be challenging and fun!

MAVERICK is divided into five zones:
 * The Maze
 * The Shrine
 * The Gallery
 * The Computer Room
 * The Arena

Each has a different theme, feel or "gimmick."  You can play transporter
games, sneak up on sniper nests, play peek-a-boo behind walls (visible
and invisible!), play run-and-gun in a cloud of baddies, or just duke it
out in the ring.

It should be almost impossible to commit suicide EXCEPT at "Easy" level,
where I do include a rocket launcher in the Gallery.  Some people enjoy
using the rockets, in which case suicide is a side effect.  Shotgun,
chaingun, bullets and shells are supplied.  There is a chainsaw
somewhere

There are no mega monsters, the worst is some Cacos in the Arena at UV
difficulty.  Troopers, sarges, imps and Lost Souls are it.  Oh, and one
demon, don't worry, he'll find you. :-)

Deathmatch exit is cooperative, requiring two players.  (A single player
exit switch in the Computer Room is blocked off in multiplayer mode.)
To exit, press the Satyr switch in the Arena, then press the same kind
of switch in the far corner (that person is stuck), then walk into the
central rotating Beacon.

A note on the Maze - opinions were mixed on mazes, with some hating them
and some loving them.  All rooms connect directly to the central Arena
so you don't need the Maze, but if you want it there it is.  My little
twist is this: Some walls are opaque, others are transparent but block
shots, and others are transparent but shoot through!  Try to outsmart
each other in the passageways.

The Gallery was just built around a visual idea I had that I thought
would look neat.  Watch the enemy go light-dark-light-dark as he
walks toward you...

Have fun and send me any comments!
