Description             : Deathmatch Prison is based on the simple idea that
                          a deathmatch should involve players using one
                          weapon of their choice, chosen before entering the
                          battle area.  All doors in the prison area stay
                          opened when pushed until closed using one of the
                          switches in the control room.  The control block
                          in the control room contains one switch for each
                          cell door.  The west row of switches controls
                          cell doors for the southern cell block and the
                          eastern row controls the northern cell block.
                          I decided not to put an exit switch, although there
                          IS an exit.  It is located outside the prison, in
                          the nitch to the left of the door.  All far walls
                          in the nitch will end the game when pushed.

[ Construction ]
============================================================================

Base                    : New level, created from scratch.
Build Time              : 8 hours.
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.0 and BSP 1.0
Known Bugs              : DOOM seems to have a small problem with the small
                          green switch tile.  If you push any of the close
                          cell switches on the control block twice in a row
                          without waiting for them to reset, the lighting
                          scheme will reverse, meaning instead of having the
                          button light up when pushed then turn dark a few
                          seconds later, it will turn dark then light up a
                          few seconds later.  As far as I know the cell doors
                          will still operate normally if this happens, but
                          it's pretty annoying.
