Description:              These wads are designed to be primarily
                          for Deathmatch play, but the author
                          intended for them to be still useful
                          and enjoyable for play by individuals 
                          (or even cooperative mode).  The designs
                          are most conducive towards exciting
                          Deathmatches, and all levels are relatively 
                          compact, but they are set up in such a 
                          way so that the other modes of play are
                          still fun and fast-moving.  


================================================================


Mission 1:                This wad uses only light weapons (pistol,
                          shotgun, and chainsaw).  Deathmatch mode
                          games will end up with a lot of chainsaw
                          fights.
                          This particular level replaces the original
                          rmh1_1.wad which has been renamed granite.wad
                          and now stands alone.
                          
Mission 2:                The setting is a secret base in a crater,
                          and features trenches, nooks, and much
                          rugged terrain for sneaking, hiding, and
                          sniping.

Mission 3:                This is a toxic waste facility, just as in 
                          the original e1m3.

Mission 4:                This outdoor area features a swimming pool
                          and a sort of garden. Sled's garden. It is 
                          clearly a recreation area for some UAC bigwigs. 
                          Things are somehwat different now...
                          Don't flip the switch that creates the 
                          stairs up to the well more than once! 
                          However, if you do, another switch behind 
                          the well resets the step.

Mission 5:                This wad is designed to be a station
                          hovering in the sky over Phobos.  One
                          can look down at the surface through 
                          the loading bay in the center. The north
                          end is where the very audible engines
                          are located.
                         
Mission 6:                A gloomy cavern, where UAC miners have
                          broken into volcanic activity, not to
                          mention other sorts of evil.

Mission 7:                As was the original e1m7, this is a
                          computer station.  It is especially
                          designed to really keep Deathmatches
                          moving.  The first appearance of the
                          famed BFG9000.

Mission 8:                The final confrontation against 
                          Sled the Impaler.  This is a pretty
                          nasty level, especially on ultra-
                          violence.

Mission 9:                This is an arena, with many pink, 
                          slobbering beasts and belligerent
                          sporting fans. Considerable chainsaw
                          action is essential.

Known Bugs              : These levels were made for Doom version 1.666. 
                          On earlier versions there may be "hall-of
                          -mirrors" effects that are a result of a maximum 
                          number of line-defs deficiency that existed 
                          in the earlier versions and which was improved 
                          in version 1.666.  Not all the levels will
                          have this problem, if it occurs.  Players
                          with Doom 1.666 should have no trouble.
