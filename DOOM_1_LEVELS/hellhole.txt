HellHole... The Story.
	Deep in the Amazon, a small fortress guards a dark secret. It's
been rumoured that a militant group has found a gateway into the Netherworld.
For months now we've heard the horrible tales from escaped prisoners telling 
of human sacrifices and offerings to Hell's GateKeeper at a temple deep within the
fortress. This group's objective is to gain favor in the eyes of the Dark One,
in hopes of gaining supernatural powers for themselves so that they can take
over the world. 
	Your mission, should you accept it, is to infiltrate this fortress,
confiscate their weapons, and destroy the GateKeeper. 
	Good Luck.


	HellHole was and still is my first attempt at designing a DOOM
PWAD. I've started it, restarted it, and made numerous revisions over 
a time period of about 2 months ( approx 60 hours design time ).
I wasn't interested in creating a huge bloodfest where you open a door
and 10 Hell Barons are coming at you and all you have is a shotgun.
Instead, I wanted to create an "environment" that had detail. I work
professionally in the CAD/CAM field, so out of habit I spent hours just
making sure that the seams on the walls lined up just right. HellHole is not a
PWAD you run through. It's confining and somewhat mazelike, but if take
a closer look you may find it interesting.
	All in all, I enjoyed dabbling with DEU and DOOM. In many ways,
DEU is a better CAD program than what I'm using now professionally. 
It's short but sweet, and I hope you enjoy it.
