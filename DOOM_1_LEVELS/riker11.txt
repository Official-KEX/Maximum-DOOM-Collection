Description             : 


Walk down the Corridor of Raw Meat, spend a night in the Disco of the 

Damned, scratch your head in the Pit of Choices, curse your fate while 

taming the Rodeo of Infinity.  Every room was designed to have a 

different feel and challenge to it, with the overall emphasis placed on 

finding yourself in a position you wouldn't have expected just a few 

seconds earlier.  For this reason, Riker11 is a much better solo or 

cooperative level than it is deathmatch, so I didn't include any 

deathmatch spots.  Feel free to add some of your own if you want to.


A good completion time, from The Zombie Shootout to The Apocalypse is 

about 20 minutes.  The end-of-game screen says 30 seconds, but if anyone 

can do it in that I tip my hat to 'em.


Some things you won't see:  doors triggered in one place you have to run 

to before they close, Wolfenstein-type secret door placement, squiggly 

little hidden things you have to find before you can continue. I never 

liked these much.  The path through Riker is clear and easy to follow, 

though hidden or off-the-path items can help you greatly.


Several spots (one in particular) were designed to be low visability, so 

if they look too dark for you on your monitor and you have DOOM v 1.2 or 

greater, press the F11 key to modify the brightness.


If the Disco of the Damned gets you down, there is a pair of infra-red 

goggles, though they're hidden in a pretty tricky place.


Enjoy.

Single Player           : Yes

Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes

Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : No

Difficulty Settings     : Yes -- Riker levels were highly optimized.

                          Levels 1 and 2 should be rather easy, level 3

                          is fairly challenging, and level 4 should be

                          hard enough for anyone to enjoy.

New Sounds              : No

New Graphics            : No

Demos Replaced          : None -- that would make it too easy.



* Construction *


Base                    : New level from scratch

Build Time              : Around 50 hours while watching lots of movies.

Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.0/5.1, BSP 1.0

Known Bugs              : None known, though I almost forgot to turn

                          on the acid.


* Changes from version 1.0


It was possible to exploit the DOOM! engine to recover both weapons from 

the Pit of Choices which, though it remained a Pit, kind of removed the 

Choices element.  This has been fixed.
