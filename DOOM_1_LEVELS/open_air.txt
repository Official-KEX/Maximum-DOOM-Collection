This is a very large Open-Air level (You need about 10 seconds to
run along one side with SHIFT down) designed for deathmatch with
more than two players. It has several components (a small village,
a 'mirkwood', a vantage point...).
Because it is so big, we decided to add some Cyber's...
Difficulty settings vary the number of them. Try deathmatch with 
difficulty 4/5 !!!
The level was made for tough fighters who don't need any kind of 
technical junk.
There is really an exit, but not easy to reach. One of you must die
often enough to find it...
The best method to play is to write messages (You won't be killed too
soon to send it. There is enough time.) and to arrange a meeting point.
