Description             :Imagine that a large, abandoned, warehouse in your 
                        home town has been overrun by nasties.  It is up to
                        you to save the day!  You must first fight your way
                        in from outside, make it through the outer offices,
                        and then finally into the warehouse itself.
                          Although difficulty levels are implemented, it is
                        always pretty tough!  Good Luck!
                          The level itself is pretty large, and may be a little
                        slow on some machines if all the nasties are running
                        around at the same time.  On a 486 it is fine.
