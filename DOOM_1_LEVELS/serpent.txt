Description             : Designed specifically for a DEATHMATCH,
                          because it's the only way I like to play
                          DOOM.

                          making me waste time making DOOM levels!

**AUTHOR'S NOTE!!**

When you give this to your friend to play over the serial port/modem
with, make sure you get a good look at the WAD with DEU or your editor
of choice. There are five to ten hidden areas chock full of special
items to give him a pounding. However, even with this advantage, playing
with RESPAWN (or NIGHTMARE) is difficult no matter what you do. Lastly,
even your opponent has equal footing, as there are weapons all over the
place.

**TECHNOLOGIES IMPLEMENTED**

I have used lifts and teleportations extensively, especially in the
teleport room. The teleport room is a bunch of pads, and you need the right
sequence to get through. The sequence is pretty easy to figure out, just
by trial and error. If RESPAWN is activated, the Sarge's have real fun with
the transports.

One last note involves the "Missile Silo," as I call it. It's the only area
where you can stock up for your rocket launcher, and you need to activate
it with a special switch or with a red key. It was a great idea until I
remembered that with DEATHMATCH you get all of the keys. The switch still
works, though. It's on top of the connector area with all of the weapons.

                 |                  |  |

                 |    |        |     \ |
                      |        |      \|
                      |________|
                      |________|
                      |        |
                      |________|

If the "XX" is pushed, the floor in the adjoining room lowers, opening
a staircase. The floor is raised to its original height by walking into
the secret area and push the wall labeled:
                            ________
           _____ __________|________|____________
          /     :
          /     :
         /___XXX:
                |
                |______________

This only works once, but that is because DOOM won't let you do it twice.
If you need to get in there again the lava pit has access for you IF you
have a red key.

**SECOND LEVEL**

Just a modified E1M1 with an absolute crapload of armor, weapons, backpacks,
teleporters, and enough changes to make this a welcome update to the
original.
