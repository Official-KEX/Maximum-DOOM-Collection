Misc. Author Info       : This is a very large level and may
                          take a fast machine to really enjoy it.
                          I pushed many of the level boundaries
                          when building this WAD, and couldn't
                          put everything in that I had planned
                          to.

Description             : Single, Multi-Player, and Deathmatch.
                          Make it to the Pyramid, get to the
                          top, and see what happens next.

                          fun and challenging experience!
                          Also...much Kudo's(?) to the creators

Known Bugs              : Some minor MIRROR effects caused by all

                          pyramid, but it's hardly noticable and
                          doesn't effect game play.
