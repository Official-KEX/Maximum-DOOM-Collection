Misc. Author Info       : I am a computer service tech. and have 
                          been playing DOOM since 0.99! It's
                          awsome on a 486DX2/66 and S3-805 VLB!!!

Description             : Forest is a three mission WAD with new
                          graphics. Look at the sky and watch for
                          some text on some walls. It also includes
                          my own demos of each level right in DOOM!
                          In 1.1, I also changed the credit screen.
                          In 1.2, I changed the IWAD to PWAD because
                          of WadMaster (thanks Raphael). In 1.3, I
                          corrected the bad DEMOs.

Additional Credits to   : Marc Lusignan for helping me debug them.
