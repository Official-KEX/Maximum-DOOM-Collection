Description             : 4 excellent deathmatch levels for DOOM.
                          Me and my friends use nothing else when
                          we run a deathmatch-weekend.
                           There were supposed to be one more level
                          but a major bug was discoverd during 
                          playtesting. Perhaps I'll include it in
                          the sequel to QUAKE!, if I ever make one.

Additional Credits to   : To id Software for the game. And to my
                          friends Richard Milland, Magnus Hansson
                          and Roger Berglund and to my brother
                          Kristoffer Andersson for playtesting and
                          for dying so satisfying during playtesting.
