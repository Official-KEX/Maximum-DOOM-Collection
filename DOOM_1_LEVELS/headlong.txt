Title                   : Headlong 
Filename                : HEADLONG.WAD

Misc. Author Info       : A doomer since Dec 10th, I can usually be found 
                          on the irc channel #doom. I'm also the author of
                          swmusfx4.

Description             : This is a deathmatch wad I made and it's not really
                          intended for single player or co-op although you
                          can play it with those methods.  For deathmatch
                          it's probably better with no monsters but I 
                          included them just the same.  There's a few sniper
                          spots on this level as well as plenty of moving
                          lifts. ;)  There _is_ a cyberdemon on the level
                          but he's only there on UV.  All the weapons are on
                          the level.  Hmm, I guess that's all there is to
                          say about it except enjoy and write me your comments!

Additional Credits to   : Jeff Rabenhorst for making _the_ best editor out
                          there, edmap.  Nova from irc for letting me in on
                          edmap info.  And various other folks from irc for              
                          testing it out!
