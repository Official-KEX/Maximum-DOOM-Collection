Title                   : JET.WAD

Description             : Deathmatch playhouse.  Lots of "detail."
			  Many sniper/hiding areas.  Also many interesting, 
			  pointless "trivial" features. NO MONSTERS 
			  except one DEMON in a cage. 5 MAIN areas:
			  Catacomb area, military "snipers" area, 
			  Museum "BFG" room, Bridges, Shrine 
			  of the All Seeing Eye.
			 
Misc Game Info          : Every area was designed with the "line of fire"
			  taken into account.  Schematic plans were drawn 
			  in about 4 hours, construction took approximately 
			  16 hours, punchlisting took about a day (during
			  which many things were touched up).  Soffits,
			  headers, etc. kept the whole WAD from having
			  huge "square" rooms with one texture.
			  
Additional Credits to   : Steven McRoberts for his comments and ideas.
			  Nash For Playtesting.
