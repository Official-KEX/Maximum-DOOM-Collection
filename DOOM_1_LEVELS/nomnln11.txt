Description             : Well, this is it!  The best DeathMatch arena that my
twisted mind could contrive.  Not very maze-like, but full of spots to hide
and ambush, this arena is good for any size DeathMatch!  The central area, 
known as No Man's Land (especially in network games) is full of danger, not
only from the six sniper holes, but from crushing pillars and a funky-looking
bridge out to the BFG and rocket launcher that is guarded from below by 
Barons, Imps, and nukage that is, literally, irresistable!  Dark, ALIENS-like
passages connect the few rooms, and platforms take you up to the sniper areas.
But beware!  Those in No Man's Land can see you quite clearly, due to the 
brilliant and flashing lighting, and can defend themselves with some success!  
I have found that experience, suprisingly, does little to aid players in this 
arena!  If you use your brain, it is easy for a novice to take down a pro with 
some very sneaky traps.

Additional Credits to   : Tod Jebe and Jeremy Look, for doing some outstanding
work in finding problem areas and suggesting changes.
