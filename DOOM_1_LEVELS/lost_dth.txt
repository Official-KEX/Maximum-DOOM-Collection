Description

A pack of two levels, only made for Death Match. You wanted a
place where you could have some fun fighting each other, I hope
you got it! This is a sequel of a PWAD I still haven't released
(should be out by the end of the month), with the sounds, 
graphics, and music removed. Thus, this PWAD is sort of a 
pre-release ;-)

I spent a week on the first level, and just about two hours on
the second. Tell me what you think of the "frag while flying" 
effect :-)

I made the music of level two on my own, using an AWE32, a GUS,
a Roland Keyboard, and Cakewalk Apprentice. It is inspired by
Two Unlimited's euro-hit: No Limit. May their new album be as
succesful as the previous :-D

Very special thanks to the wonderful crew that helped me get
Lost_Dth where it now is, by giving me very convincing arguments on how
to improve the level. Namely:

jayson@cs.tamu.edu, Tom.Holmes%8N1@hyit.oau.org,
fookilla@u.washington.edu, BARNASH@COLLEGE.MED.UFL.EDU,
geertges@rintintin.Colorado.EDU, LordJim718@aol.com,
stasiak@iinet.com.au, and all the other helpful people I cannot think
of right now. Thanks you guies.

I hope our next Episode's gonna rock! (of this I am almost sure, you're
so talented!)

BTW We're still looking for some beta-testers. If you wanna help,
drop me a note, I'd be so happy.

And of course, nothing would have been possible without the 
devotion of scores of people like those at iD, the authors of
Deu, BSP, MIDI2MUS, MUS2PWAD, ... Sicere congratulations to all
of them.
