Points of Interest      : This is my second level that I have ever made. After
			  spending several weeks playing Heretic and several 
			  months playing Doom I grew bored.  Deathmatch 
			  revived my love for these two games.  Good 
			  deathmatch levels are few and far between.
			  Thus my quest began.  The ultimate deathmatch
			  levels were born.  I had the luxury to have these
			  levels beta tested at the Incredible Universe in
			  Phoenix Az.  I was honored when they made my levels  
			  the official Death in a Purple Shirt contest WAD. 
			  That is where the name came from these are the 
			  Purple Death levels. So far I am very pleased with 
			  the reviews and encourage any comments you may have.
			  Thanks for trying these levels and I promise to 
			  release more in the near future.

			  Notes of interest: Since you have read this far I will                               
			  give you some hints.  The ONLY place to get the wings
			  and 200+ armor is in the graveyard.  One of the tombstones
			  triggers a lift in the courtyard.

			  There is also a secondary egg located near one of the 
			  waterfalls in a hidden room.   
			  
			  Lastly the exit is located by the dead end of the river.
