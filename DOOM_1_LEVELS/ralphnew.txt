Title                   : CROSSING ACHERON 
Author                  : John W. Anderson (aka Dr. Sleep)
E-mail Address          : drsleep@delphi.com;CIS:74002,2157;AOL:DrSleep107

Additional Credits  : Rapha‰l Quinet and Brendon J. Wyber for DEU 5.21;
               : Colin Reed for BSP v1.1 (can't DEU without it);
               : War Machine for endless Deathmatch tests (am I 
                 getting any better?); 
               : Terry C. Ramey and Sebastian Kirke for BETA critiques
                 and other witty and useful suggestions (I didn't use
                 any of 'em <g>);
               : Vanni Fucci and his figs;
               : And, of course, those id guys. (You and Quinet owe
                 my wife a BIG apology. But you have MY regards.)

Description             : As in my first level -- DANTE'S GATE -- I have tried
                 in CROSSING ACHERON to achieve a gaming atmosphere
                 that is not only fast-paced (once the fur starts to
                 fly), but just plain creepy. Once again, I went for
                 the aesthetics (you know: The Look); but this time,
                 I also tried to keep the game from being too
                 easy. I think once you get inside, you'll find that
                 CROSSING ACHERON has been fully optimized for
                 DEATHMATCH.  But it's just as enjoyable (if I do say
                 so myself) in Single-player and Co”perative modes.

                 CROSSING ACHERON (pronounced 'ak eron) is a sequel
                 to DANTE'S GATE -- thematically, anyway.  (It's an 
                 E1M3 only because I thought the music was more
                 appropriate than M2.) For any of the two or three 
                 of you out there who have read Dante Alighieri's 
                 THE DIVINE COMEDY -- or even only "Inferno" -- 
                 I'm sure you've been able to appreciate the many 
                 allusions to this work in DOOM. I have tried to 
                 take a tack of my own along the same lines. (I do
                 this not only because I think the idea is neat, but
                 so that people will think that I'm very clever.)
                 I'm not so na‹ve as to expect everyone to rush out
                 and get a copy of "Inferno" (I mean, it IS pretty
                 tedious stuff, at times), but it's well worth the
                 read -- and a little patience is a virtue that is
                 often well-rewarded.

                 (By the way: Acheron is a river in Hell (basically).
                 But don't look for any rivers in here: I tried it
                 several different ways and just wasn't convinced.)

                 I thank those of you who sent me mail on my previous
                 effort, and I hope to hear from more of you about
                 this one.  (Just a line would do: "It's great!"
                 or "It sucks!" or "Now I know what John Cormack
                 MEANT to do in "Unholy Cathedral.")

                 Thanks.  Hope you like it.

Instructions        : Put ACHERON.WAD in your DOOM directory, type
                 "doom -devparm -file acheron.wad -wart 1 3 -skill <#>"
                 (Or, to play moderately at first, also put the file
                 ACHE.BAT in your DOOM directory and type ACHE.  And
                 you'll get one.)

                 This PWAD has been tested and tested ad infinitum, so
                 it shouldn't mess with your computer or anything else

                 that's the way the cookie crumbles.  Don't come cryin'
                 to me.  It must be something YOU did.  If you don't
                 like it, lump it. (I ran out of clich‚s.)

Description             : This is a DEATHMATCH 2.0 pwad.
                          Please play this wad with the -altdeath
                          rules only (Doom 1.666). Old deathmatch
                          is no fun with this pwad - you need 
                          respawning items !

                          Ayrton is the second part of my deathmatch
                          2.0 trilogy: 1. peace_20
                                       2. ayrton_2
                                       3. coming soon !
                       
                       *  This new version of ayrton.wad has larger
                       *  rooms so you have more space to fight.
                       *  I included difficulty levels that change
                       *  the type of weapons available:
                         
                           1 and 2 : Rocket Launcher
                                 3 : Rocket Launcher + Plasma
                           4 and 5 : Rocket Launcher + Plasma + BFG
                         
                          (Shotgun, chaingun, chainsaw and Berserker at
                           every level.)
                           
                           -> I recommend to play skill level 4.
                           The BFG is not easy to use in this level -
                           the best weapon for ayrton is the plasma gun.

                          Monsters: one Trooper :)
                          !! try to keep the Trooper alive while
                          !! playing deathmatch
                          
Info                    : This is my latest Deathmatch pwad.
                          The level is very compact, so you

Description             : This wad was designed solely for DEATHMATCH.
                          No bloodbath arenas here!  If you like a wad with 
                          a lot of ambush points and stalking positions, this
                          is the one for you (I enjoy it, anyway). I've never
                          played this Wad in a 3 or 4 person DEATHMATCH, so 
                          if you do, I'd like to hear how it fared.  I'd also
                          be interested in seeing any LMP's made in this Wad.
                          I'd also be interested in hearing any comments of
                          what you thought (This is my first Wad, so please
                          be merciful!).

=============================

This WAD is a big area good for multiplayer NETDOOM.  It's got tons of 
weapons and no armor---- so be prepared to die LOTS!  We've been playing 
it around here for a few days, and the matches can easily last >>>1 hr.

Have Fun!

Author                  : Tom Neff
Email Address           : tneff@panix.com

Description             : This was a "contract WAD" for a well known
                          Deathmatch tournament organizer who ultimately 
                          couldn't use it for business reasons.  The 
                          client's requirements were that it run on 1.2, be
                          pretty fast, have no nukage or other non-combat
                          hazards, and have the exit clearly marked but
                          hard to abuse.  My goals were that it look
                          memorable, play well, and have graded difficulty.
                          The result was influenced by my travels in Taos 
                          and the High Southwest.  I hope you like it.

Episode and Level #     : E1M1 (but requires Registered WAD)
Single Player           : By all means look around.
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Ditto
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Yes - all 10 start points are there.
Difficulty Settings     : Yes.  Easy has more ammo and health and easier
                          access to the rocket launcher.  Hard is fairly
                          stingy but everyone gets a decent weapon.  You
                          can get a launcher on Hard but you make yourself
                          pretty obvious when you do... you'll see!

This is my fourth Deathmatch collection that groups my first three into 
one full three episode replacement.

Play using "doom -file ralphnew.wad" (you must have the registered version).

This is the source for this new wad pak:

My highest regard to all WAD authors, you did a fantastic job guys!

Enjoy.
SPUNK.ZIP is a zipped PWAD-file, containing an entirely new map 
for level E1M1, made with DEU 5.0 ... I meant it especially for 
deathmatch-play; there's no exit, so you have to play till you drop! 
Especially -respawn is fun!

Do you have the SPUNK to play this?

Mail any suggestions or comments to: bl227@cleveland.freenet.edu

Happy DOOMing!

Greetings... Richard Smol

P.S.: I love those sergeants! Bring 'em on! Bring 'em on!

Description             : Two "SUPER" Deathmatch levels
                 SUPER22.WAD - Great for 2 players, untested with 
                     > 2 You can really rack up the frags and have
                     a good time doing it!  When we quit one
                     particular session, I had 80 Frags and my
                     opponent had about 40.
                     Go look at the CYBERDEMON...it can't hurt
                     you until the barrels are blown up.                         
                    
                     Kill the CYBERDEMON together, or leave 
                     it out there to make things interesting.
                  SUPER33.WAD - Probably better with > 2 players 
                     although we had a pretty good time with two.  
                     Not as heavily playtested as SUPER22.

Additional Credits to   : Terry Hamel [author of BUNKER.WAD] and Jeff
                          Magar, for extensive Deathmatch testing and
                          helpful criticism.  This level's name was
                          inspired by Terry's often-aggravating style of
                          Deathmatch play.  DAMN Zee Rat!  <grin>

Notes                   : Provides a great variety of gaming action in
                          every mode of play.  Lends itself to numerous
                          strategies.  Very intense Deathmatch action.
                          This level has been fully tested, critiqued,
                          and "debugged".  Designed for and tested with
                          DOOM v1.2.
