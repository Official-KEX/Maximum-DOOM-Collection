Description             : After playing RIP3.WAD a bit, that screwup
                          with the 16 linedefs was getting to be a little
                          bit too much.  I am putting this out because it
                          fixes most of the problems in RIP3.WAD.  Still
                          the same idea, board.. ledges you have to stay on
                          to get the guns, etc.
