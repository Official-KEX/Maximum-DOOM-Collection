Misc. Author Info       : I hate boring deathmatches.

Description             : This is another in the arena-like series
                          of my wads.  (There are now 3 and more on
                          the way.)  This one is much more chaotic
                          than any of the others.  The was is again basically  
                          a large dark room with weapons scattered around on
                          pedestals.  However, this time, the whole
                          room is like climbing twisty stairs- it reminds
                          me of mountain climbing.  Also as a bonus....
                          there is a SECOND ROOM of the same terrain with
                          a plasma gun and the chainsaw.  There are few
                          obvious hiding places in this wad, but there is
                          plenty of room for creativity.  If you liked the
                          original markroom, you might like this one.

                          There is a non-coop exit located in the SE corner.

                          Make sure to look at the wad in an editor before
                          you go too long.  There are a few hidden lifts that
                          I didn't make really obvious.
