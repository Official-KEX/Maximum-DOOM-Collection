						  episode WAD (look for it soonish).

Description             : This is the deathmatch level of the Spooky series.
						  It will probably be the secret level to my Spooky
						  episode. I can't really "set a mood" - this level
						  is designed for pure deathmatch (2.0 recommended).
						  It's a medium size, but due to clever circular
						  design coupled with strategic windows, in a 3 or
						  4 player game you can almost always see an opponent.


Additional Credits to   : The usual suspects! iD, the author of Edmap (great
						  editor!) and the Ledges series for a bit of 
						  inspiration.
