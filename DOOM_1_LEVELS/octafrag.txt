                          Raphael et. al. for DEU - the BEST DOOM editor!

Description		: This is a DEATHMATCH-only level, designed for
			  optimal fragging. Although the level is small, the
			  rooms are multiply and redundantly connected so it
			  seems larger than it really is and the action
			  will always be fast and furious. No toxic waste or
			  barrels, so suicide wussies have no choice but to
			  duke it out 'till the end. ;-) This also means that
			  there are no sniper's nests per se; be sure to
			  watch your back! Other features are a unique central
			  elevator shaft with four random lifts, as well as
			  a cooperative exit which requires at least two
			  players to operare. Happy fragging!!

Known Bugs		: On rare occasions I've had DOOM freeze up while
			  playing this WAD. It passes all the DEU consistency
			  checks, and plays fine most of the time. Also, I've
			  seen similar freeze-ups while playing other PWADs,
			  so it may be just my machine. If you experience the
			  problem and can pinpoint the cause, please let
			  me know.
