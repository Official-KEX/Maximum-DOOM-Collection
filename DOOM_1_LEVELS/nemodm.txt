Description           : Deathmatch level for Doom 1.666.  This level 
                        is fast and furious fun for 2-4 combatants.  
                        Multiple kill lanes covering each major weapon
                        is a feature of NemoDM. *YES* there is a
                        ship with masts and a cargo hold (thanks DB!) ;)  
                        Note: There is one area which is a great spot 
                        for sniping, but not easy to find.  Look for
                        a U turn hallway with metal textures on the
                        walls.  Some of these walls are passable.
                        Note2: Red pad starts the crusher, Blue pad stops
                        it!  Have fun!  Then Feedback!
