Misc. Author Info       : I *AM* root, so don't even think about it!

Description             : Your team has been called in to clean out
                          one of UAC's power plants, but in the first
                          hallway, the ceiling behind you collapses,
                          burying almost all of your soldiers.  Looks
                          like the only way out now is to use the
                          facility's transporter pad on the other side
                          of the building.
