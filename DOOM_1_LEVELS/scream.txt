    ---- Scream Level ---
   "Zork - with a shotgun"

This level is a little larger and more involved than my last level
(Daemon2).

Scream is designed mainly for solo players.  I have no idea how well
it would play on deathmatch or co-op.

Scream incorporates some rather nasty puzzles which you will have to
solve to complete the level.  There are clues and you will have to
use your eyes and brain as well as your trigger finger.

A number of people sent me mail regarding Daemon2 - mostly claiming
I hadn't made doors or provided switches.  That's ok - after all,
I'm interested to hear of any bugs, but in all cases it was because
the players hadn't done something.  I can assure you that all of
the puzzles have been checked and tested.  They can all be solved
*without* resorting to cheat keys.  This applies to Scream as well.

BTW, to complete this level successfully you should end up with a
kill ratio of about 90%.  Not all of the monsters have to be killed :)
If you can do 100% - good luck to you - you are a true doom.god.

Have fun.
