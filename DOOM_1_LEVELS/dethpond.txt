Title                   : Pond of the Deathmatch Crater
Filename                : DETHPOND.WAD
Author                  : Michael Lundy
Email Address           : Rememer what I said in the CLP text file?
Misc. Author Info       : Check out my other works of art;
                          Houses 1.2 (1.3 coming soon),
                          Another Heretic Cathedral,
                          and The Dark Forces Rifle Patch
                          Cargo Landing Pad

                          I'm also thinking of uploading my Super Shotgun
                          patch, because it does so well in Deathmatch.

Some Things I'd like to : Here are two files uploaded with a ZIP error                        
Say                       MUSICAL1.ZIP
                          MOVIE1.ZIP

                          I still hate the word KEWL. It sucks!

                          The Innocent Crew forgot to upload their level WAD
                          within OBTIC2.ZIP. They uploaded a text file a few
                          days ago to the incoming directory, but the FTP
                          operators deleted it (I think).

Description             : This outside arena is so complicated that I had to
                          block some areas from visplane areas that happened
                          in corners of the level. I mean "complicated"
                          as in there are a lot of 2 sided linedef around.
                          DEU's node builder could barely handle it. 
                          
                          This level includes a giant pond
                          with a "storm drain" room adjacent to it. It also
                          has a drop hole with an invisibility sphere in
                          of it, so you can drop down in surprise and shoot
                          something.

                          I know you may have seen other "pool" or "pond"
                          levels, but this one is way different.

                          Expect this WAD to be in Houses 1.3 and to look
                          much better in that DOOM 2 WAD.

                          One other thing; EVERYTHING TEXTURE IS ALIGNED!!

* Play Information *

Episode and Level #     : DOOM 1 E1M1 (Hey, the walls still look good for
                          such a limited choice of textures.)
Single Player           : Yes, but I wouldn't recommend it.

New Graphics            : Yes. I stole the waterfall graphics from VS3.WAD
                          I also made a new ending screen, which is sort of
                          a graphics piece. It appears that I'm the only one
                          who can make an ending screen that gives you a dos
                          prompt in the correct color: gray
New Music               : Yes, but DeuTex keeps thinking that it is a lump 
                          of data. It's a Nirvana song.
Demos Replaced          : None. Sorry, I don't know anyone who has a 14,400
                          baud modem and DOOM 1.

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.21, DEUTEX 3.4, ENDOOMER 1.0.1

                          my level, I got kicked out because of visplane
                          errors. I fixed them, but I am still a little
                          curios to look for new ones. I havent foud any
                          on my copy of DOOM v1.9

Authors MAY use this level as a base to build additional levels, but only 
if it improves deathmatch play. You may also take the music from my WAD 
because I didn't write or re-record the song.

* Where to get this WAD *

FTP sites: ftp.cdrom.com (You may find this on a CD, because that FTP site
           says their DOOM stuff will be put on a CD. It sucks that they're
           making money off of my stuff!)

BBS numbers: No.

Other: Nothing here either.
