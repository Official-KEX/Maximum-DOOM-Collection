** READ FURTHER FOR LEVEL INFO **

This is my third Wad for Heretic.  It is however my first "stab" at a
single player level.  There are however some significant features that
should provide for an enjoyable DeathMatch.  When playing DeathMatch,
there are differences in Item placement.  This level also contains its
share of special line defs to open and close doors and operate lifts, but
you will have to figure these out for yourself.

Don't forget to try higher difficulty settings!  More monsters and items
are in the level when you play "Black Plague" and "Smite Meister" modes.
