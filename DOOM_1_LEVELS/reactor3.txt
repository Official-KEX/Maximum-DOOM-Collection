	It seems there was an error with the original REACTOR1.WAD that 
	locks up doom when played, that little problem has been fixed.
	This Reactor.WAD has _NOTHING_ to do with reactor2.wad by that
	other dude....

Description             :       
  Scene    :      The site of A fusion reactor.
  Situation: CRITIAL; An infultration team entered the reactor a day 
		      ago to check on reports of missing personel and 
		      strange happenings with the equipment.  A half-hour
		      ago, all the power went out in the nearby colony.
		      You've just been ordered to go in, along with your
		      partner, and investigate.  
  
		      Upon entering, you and your partner immediately find
		      yourselves under a rain of heavy gunfire.  You managed
		      to dive outta the way, unfortunately you can't say the
		      same for your partner, you look up just in time to 
		      see him look at you for help, hand reached out toward
		      you.  *KA-BOOM*  Your partner's body falls to the 
		      ground lifelessly.  

		      Rage fills every part of your being as you look up
		      at the enemy, and then total horror hits you.  Your
		      partner was just gunned down by one of the members
		      of the infultration team!  NO TIME TO THINK!! 
		      *KA-BOOM*  The shot rips through your shoulder....
		      You unload three shots into the person standing before
		      you.   
	
		      As you examine the body of the man you just killed,
		      you are horrified when you notice the condition of the
		      body.  "Three bullets couldn't have done this much 
		      damage?!"  Well, no matter, you know what you were
		      sent to do, and you know you can't trust anyone else 
		      you meet here.....
