Title                   : Shogun

Filename                : shogun.WAD

Author                  : Dan Lefebvre

Description:		: Basically, a circular design with connecting
			: hallways through the middle, and a few side
			: hallways.  All the weapons are here, and 
			: unlike some deathmatch wads, there are many
			: areas where fighting is common.  Lots of 
			: ways to back door your targets!

Suggestions for Play	: The start points are raised up from the
			: main play area, and are considered to be
			: "safe zones".  So, you're not supposed
			: to shoot anyone when you are in the start
			: areas.  Once the players jump down to the
			: floor, they are fair game.  This is the
			: way we play, and it keeps the "cheap" frags
			: to a minimum.

Additional Credits to   : Bennet Deliduka for providing the network
			: that sucked our lives away
