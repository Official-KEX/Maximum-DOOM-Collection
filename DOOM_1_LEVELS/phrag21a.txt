Description:
   This is a big, complex, challenging, and interesting deathmatch wad. 
Every room has an exit! It's not always obvious, but there is always at
least one way out (and I don't mean by dying). 
   I wanted a wad with some new scenery.  Something to entertain me
while I'm falling the the ground, grabbing my throat, or while I'm
frying my opponent with bright blue bursts of plasma.  Therefore, this
wad contains *SIX* gray-scale images of *NAKED* women.  None of that
skank stuff, this is high-class professional photography.  If you are
offended by this, then DO NOT PLAY IT!
   This level was designed before version 1.4 came out, so it has an
abundance of health and ammo.  Thus, there is no need for the -altdeath
argument.  Using it will not only spoil most of the strategies of the
level, but will allow one person (whoever gets there first) to dominate
the entire game (because he/she would never run out of ammo or health,
and could easily and effectivley guard both entrances).
