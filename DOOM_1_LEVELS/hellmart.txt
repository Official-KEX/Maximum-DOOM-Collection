Here's our first PWAD (actually two PWADS). It is a collaborative effort
between my friend from work and myself. Let me know how you like it or if you
have any suggestions for improvement...

Title             :HELLMART.WAD
Author            :Jim Higgins & Paul Romiti
Email Address     :veggie@nando.net (Jim Higgins)

Description       :This level replace Episode 1, Map 1. It is a stand-alone
                  level and is not meant to blend in with the standard DOOM 
                  levels. It is modeled after the grocery store that we work
                  in...hence the name hellmart. We tried to duplicate the 
                  store as closely as possible. We even included a cardboard 
                  baler and meat cooler. The wad plays well in a deathmatch. 
                  You never know what aisle your opponent is hiding in.

                        WinTex 3.4 for the sound PWAD
Known Bugs             :A little slow in the beginning due to large # of
                        enemies. After they are dead it speeds up quite a bit.
                        We had an HOM problem in one area of the game during 
                        deathmatch play but I think we fixed it.
