Misc. Author Info       : Hardcore, hopeless, terminal Doom
                        : Deathmatch addict.  Author of a few Wads.
                        : Co-ordinator of Trials & Tribulations

                        : team mailing list)

Description             : Large room in the middle, where all the
                        : action is.  Several raised ledges around
                        : the perimeter of this room, where the start
                        : points, and the weapons are.  Also some
                        : connecting passages around the outside.
                        : We have literally hundreds of hours on this
                        : level.  It's fast.  IT ROCKS.  Nuff said.

Suggestions for Play    : The start points are considered safe zones,
			: or at least they are when we play.  But, as
			: soon as you step forward into the hallway
			: that connects to the pit, you are fair game.
			: This works well for our games, and keeps
			: the "cheap" frags to a minimum.

Additional Credits to   : Bennet Deliduka for providing the network
			: that sucked my life away
