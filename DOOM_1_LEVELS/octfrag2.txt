Filename                : octfrag2.wad

Misc. Author Info       : Only DooM is real :)     

Description       :  This is a DEATHMATCH-only level, designed for optimal 
		  fragging. Although the level is small, the rooms are 
		  multiply and redundantly connected so it seems larger 
		  than it really is and the action will always be fast 
		  and furious. No toxic waste or barrels, so suicide 
		  wussies have no choice but to duke it out 'till the end. 
		  This also means that there are no sniper's nests per se; 
		  be sure to watch your back! Other features are a unique 
		  central elevator shaft with four random lifts, as well as
		  a cooperative exit which requires at least two players 
		  to operate. Happy fragging!! This modified version is 
		  optimized for altdeath! No BFG's but all other weapons 
		  are there. Secrets are not obvious.
