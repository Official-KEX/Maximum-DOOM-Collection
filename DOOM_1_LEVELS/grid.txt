Description             : This is a deathmatch level set in a 
                          grid of criss-crossing upper and lower
                          corridors with moving floors at each 
                          intersection. The upper corridors run
                          north to south and are connected by
                          windows. The lower corridors run east
                          to west, and are dark. Shotgun,
                          chaingun and chainsaw are available,
                          with a rocket launcher in the middle.
