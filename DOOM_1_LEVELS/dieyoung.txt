Description             : FOR REGISTERED VERSION OF HERETIC ONLY!!
                          A Haphazard collection of large and small
			  rooms that should "kill" your evening.
			  There are some monsters to eliminate, but
			  the real action is your opponent.  Some
			  weapons are difficult to get and the FireMace
			  is damn near impossible.

To get the the Mace in "Die Young" you must be a chicken and you must
be flying.  There are 2 teleporters at the top of the stone column in the
outdoor area.  One of these teleporters will take you directly to the
mace and the other will not.  There are 2 teleporters there to keep your
opponent from knowing for sure where you will reappear at.
