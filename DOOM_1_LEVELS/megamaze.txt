                          for nothing at all. It just looks good. 
                          I like email. Please send me some. And for those
                          who say to leave computers to the adults,
                          I'm 13 and can DEU, program, and surf the net just
                          as well as anybody else.
                          
Description             : really big maze. A few good sniper points, and
                          a pretty good secret area. First level is really
                          just a "signature". You'll see what I mean. I put
                          it first rather than second so people actually see
                          it. Also, be warned that there are exactly 4 d-match
                          starts in e1m1, right next to each other. Like I
                          said, it's really just a sig level. Agree not to
                          shoot until e1m2.
