Description             : The second version of my first WAD.  Designed for 
			  single player, multiple player or Deathmatch modes, 
			  easy, medium or hard. Looks much like a Castle, 
			  complete with moats, dungeons, secret passages, 
			  temples, and even an open pit mine where they 
			  obviously got all of that green marble (and there 
			  is a lot of green marble).  I added a section at 
			  the end which seems to me to be well designed 
			  for deathmatch, but I didn't get around to putting 
			  the deathmatch startpoints there. It is a very 
			  large wad and could drag at times on slower 
			  machines. I fixed the problem with the first 
			  version in the temple where there seemed to be 
			  invisible walls, it was actually dead bodies 
			  hanging from the ceiling. You couldn't see them 
			  but they still blocked your movements.

Additional Credits to   :  Richard Janis and Steve Coulber for creative 
			   input and testing.
