************************STORYLINE*************************
Ho hum. Another boring day in Metro City. You and your fellow
sanitation engineers have woken up and started the long, hard 
days work of cleaning up under the city. You don't understand why,
I mean, who the hell comes down here anyway? But, the city's payin'
you for it, so why argue, right? Strange that they gave you all pistols
before you came down. Must be some damn big rats down here. Life sucks.
Now, if you were a bounty hunter, then maybe some big bucks would roll in.
Like those creatures that pop up every now and then in the city. The 
posters say that the city pays $10,000 for every body of those things you
bring in. Too bad you've never seen one. Suddenly a message comes through 
on the loudspeakers.
"Attention all sanitation engineers! We have a sudden infestation of life
form LO-17 in sector 22, level 1. All engineers in that area be aware."
Life form LO-17? That's the designation for those creatures! If you can bag 
a few, you can get rich quick! Wait a minute. Those other guys are
probably thinking the same thing. Better take them out too.
Time to show those goons why sanitation is a dead-end job....
