Title                   : The Day Hell Froze Over...  
Filename                : FROZEN.WAD
Author                  : Zink The Dink
Email Address           : Zink TD@aol.com, jeffcarr@fox.nstn.ca
Misc. Author Info       : I am myself. I think...

Description             : Well, the cows have come home, pigs are flying, the 
                          fat lady has sung her tune, and now, yes, hell has 
                          frozen over! Just in time for the holiday season,
                          you can frag some bad-asses over satan's now icy
                          domain!!!

                          This wad is meant for deathmatch, though sadly I
                          have not been able to test it out for myself!! 
                          If someone would be so kind as to try it out and
                          then tell me if it's any good, I'd really be 
                          greatful!!!

                          NOTE: Run the wad from the batch file (frozen)
                          `cause the new floor texture has to be added.
                          Don't worry, it'll replace it after it's done,
                          just run the batch file.

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch 
Editors used            : DEU 5.2 gcc, IDBSP 1.0, ENDOOMER v1.0.2 (made by
                          me, of course) DMMUSIC 1.0, DMGRAPH 1.1, DMTEX 1.0c
                          (none of that wussy deutex crap...)
Known Bugs              : If you're playing this with DOOM version 1.2, you
                          may experience some slight HOM due to the size of
                          the level and the number of two-sided linedefs.
                          Hey! Don't blame it on me! It was id that made it
                          so you could only see 16 2-sided linedefs at once,
                          not me!!!




* Copyright / Permissions *

Authors MAY use this level as a base to build additional
levels if they lack the creativity to create their own.  
But please tell me if you're going to try to rip off one
of my textures, since you'll probably have trouble getting
it to work with your wad

You may do whatever you want with this file. See if I care.
