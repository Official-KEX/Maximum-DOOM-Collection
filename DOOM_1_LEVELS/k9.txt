Description             : With my fertile imagination I failed 
                          to come up with an honest reason for 
                          this level. But have fun.  Keith
                        
                        Story typed by Dave.

                        In deepest, darkest Durham, deviously, 
                        dastardly, demonstrative, (etc.),demonic
                        forces have found fertile ground amongst 
                        the disillusioned 'Populous'. :) You 
                        were sent in to break into the cult's HQ 
                        and rifle their computer system but 
                        guess what?? You've set off the alarm.:)
                        Well, at least it can't be as bad as 
                        Hell...could it?

Additional Credits to   : Dave Murray for testing this level to 
                           hell and back! :)
