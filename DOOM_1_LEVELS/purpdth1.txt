Points of Interest      : This is my first level for I have ever made. My goal
			  was to make a good, fast deathmatch level that would
			  hold its own against Ledges or some of the Raven series.
			  This level bogs a little in one area on my DX2-66 so your
			  results may vary ( my DX4-100 runs most of the rest 1 
			  to 2 dots ).  
			  
			  Notes: I put in the teleporters to make the game quicker. After
			  the first hour of deathmatch the level exceeded its goals. Learn
			  the teleporter locations and destinations and you can do well.
			  Flying is also key to success this level will reward you if you can
			  fly and shoot well at the same time.

			  Fun things to do: Trap a teleport destination.  You do this by moving
			  a cheese ball ( gas bag ) over a teleport destination.  When someone
			  teleports in BOOM! Cool looking too. This level also has a spot 
			  where teleport frags can be planned.  I had a friend catch me leaving
			  the teleporter by the split staircases, I threw an egg, he launched
			  a volley of arrows. The blast blew me back through the teleporter
			  and the next thing I saw was a chicken flying through my remains.

			  The exit is back where the water starts. It is the switch by the 
			  glowing sparkles.
