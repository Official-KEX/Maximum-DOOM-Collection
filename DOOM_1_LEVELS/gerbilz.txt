Misc. Author Info       : the name Gerbilz just came to me in a dream. The
                          wad actually looks nothing like any rodent in 
                          particular.

Description             : Simply two levels of choice deathmatch heaven.
                          Chainsaws and more chainsaws and other goodies.
                          
Additional Credits to   : the people who wrote deu and bsp and doom.

Play hints: Stay out of the doors on the second level-they hurt.   This is 
quite my first attempt at wadmaking, so please be gentle(flames aren't really
necessary are they?). If it looks like you're stuck in a hole with only a 
rocket launcher, then you are(sorry about your luck).  Have fun.
