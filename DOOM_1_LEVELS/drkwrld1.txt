Author Notes            : This is my first real level.  My Dad has helped
                          fix textures and the way it works.  I am going
                          to be 11 in July.  I hope to work on Doom II 
                          levels as soon as I find and learn a new editor.

Dad's Notes             : This kid really did this all himself, I only 
                          helped debug and help with a few times the safety
                          copies got all hosed up.  It is really cool
                          having so much in common with a son.

Description             : This level has a lot of maze like halls and
                          requires all the key cards to pass.  There are
                          eight secrets.

Hints                   : Need blue card first, then red, then yellow.

Special Thanks to       : ID for this great game.
