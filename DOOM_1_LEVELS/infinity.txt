Title                   : SERENITY III aka INFINITY (v1.1)
                          A full replacement for the first episode of
                          Doom, registered version (we have made 8
                          levels - sorry, no bonus level in this one,
                          but you won't miss it...).
                          Changes since v1.0 (which was released about
                          one week ago...): fixed a visplanes-error in
                          level 4 (of which I was sure that I'd fixed
                          it...). Added more monsters (on people's
                          requests... 8-). Fixed a few minor things we
                          had overlooked. Changed two switches one level
                          one, which could cause a player to get stuck.


                          In the months after the release of SERENITY
                          and ETERNITY, Holger has been working hard and
                          has managed to create a worthy successor of
                          both SERENITY and ETERNITY, and has made the
                          Serenity Trilogy complete!!
                          INFINITY has most of the look & feel of
                          Eternity, which means rooms with a cool &
                          consistent use of textures, and lots of
                          'architecture' in it. Again we have included a
                          few puzzles in the various levels, but not as
                          much as in Serenity (I). The gameplay is,
                          again, touch but doable on "Hurt me plenty".
                          You will have to be careful, though, not to waste
                          your ammo...! AND YOU WON'T HAVE TO USE ANY
                          CHEATS!!
IMPORTANT               : Do NOT move this level to another episode,
                          since you can't finish the last level (8) if it
                          isn't played as E1M8!
                          IF YOU USE DOOM 1.2 OR LOWER, RUN INFINITY WITH
                          THE INFIWITH.BAT. IF YOU USE 1.666 (and
                          above?), USE THE INFINONE.BAT WHICH DOESN'T
                          INCLUDE MUSIC! (some versions of Doom crash on
                          this... - if your Doom I version does, than
                          use the INFINONE.BAT)

Filename                : INFINITY.WAD
Authors                 : Bjorn Hermans and Holger Nathrath. Holger did
                          ALL of the design work this time + the
                          selection of the music.

Misc. Author Info       : Two guys with too much spare time (especially
                          Holger - at least so it seems...!)

Description             : This set of 8 levels has been made with the
                          word quality in mind. It's Mind here, not
                          Muscles! We have tried to find a good mixture
                          of action, architecture and adrenaline.
                          Some of the levels may be a breeze, others may
                          be a real pain in the *ss. But remember one
                          thing: YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THE CHEATS!!!
                          There are a few very though places, but they
                          can be done. When it seems you can't get
                          around them without using the cheats, you may
                          be doing it the wrong way and/or you may have
                          missed something(s).
                          Hidden entrances to rooms can always be
                          recognized in some way (different texture,
                          different light-level, etc.).

Additional Credits to   : DEU (5.2GCC and 5.21), BSP (1.2x) and their
                          many contributors; Id (no comment); all those
                          people who have been so kind to send us
                          remarks and feed-back about our previous
                          wad-files (NATHRATH, SERENITY and ETERNITY);
                          every WADmaker whose WAD has been a source of
                          inspiration for the rooms in INFINITY.

                          And all those many others we have forgotten.

* Play Information *

Episode and Level #     : E1M1 through E1M8, see below for descriptions
Single Player           : Yes
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes (although untested)
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Yes (although untested)
Difficulty Settings     : Yes, there are three.
New Sounds              : No (See "Other Releases")
New Graphics            : Yes, although most Wad-managers won't spot
                          them.
                          All patches work just fine in both 1.2 and 1.666.
                          (so probably in all higher Doom I versions)
New Music               : Yes! We have, again, made an unusual selection
                          of all kinds of musical pieces (we personally
                          just love the one of level 7...)
                          (make sure you use the right batch-file: that
                          is INFIWITH.BAT for Doom 1.2 and earlier, and
                          INFINONE.BAT for Doom 1.666. We don't know if
                          higher Doom versions (than 1.666) will work
                          properly with extra add-on music. If Doom
                          crashes while playing INFINITY WITH music,
                          then try it without extra music.
Demos Replaced          : None


* Descriptions *

Level 1 Description     : "Three Is A Magic Number"
                          A warm welcome & a warm start! This is what
                          Infinity is all about! (so get used to it...)

Level 2 Description     : "Say Jazz To Another Excess"
                          Be on your guard in this level. There is more
                          than meets the eye here.

Level 3 Description     : "Beat It!"
                          You'd better be warmed up be now, as the
                          action really starts on this level. Some spots
                          are though. Some spots may even seem unfair...
                          at FIRST sight...
                          Don't make your brown eyes BLUE...

Level 4 Description     : "Everybody Frag Now"
                          This is a real treat: there is fun (a
                          labyrinth) and there is relaxation (a
                          'tropical' island) and there is... Well,
                          you'll see it when you get there.

Level 5 Description     : "Dungeons Of Doom"
                          Will you reach the eNd??
                          (will you like the 'joke'?)

Level 6 Description     : "Who's Afraid Of Red, Yellow And Blue?"
                          Anything you'd want in a level... (?) Making
                          the right choices (or should we say
                          'guesses'?) is essential in this level. At
                          least if you'd like to stay ALIVE...!

Level 7 Description     : "Blaze Of Glory"
                          After Red; Fight
                          After Blue; Think
                          After Yellow; exiT

Level 8 Description     : "StarGate Into Infinity"
                          A Finale that is sharp as a knive, and which
                          gives you the creepy feeling that you have
                          seen this terrible sight before...


* Construction *

Base                    : 8 new levels from scratch.
Construction Time       : About one month.

Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.21 and 5.22GCC, plus BSP 1.2x and IDBSP.

Known Bugs              : There are a few small HOMs to be seen (when you
                          use Doom 1.2 or earlier) in some rooms,
                          because of the many linedefs. There aren't any
                          places where it is very prominent in sight,
                          nor where it distracts you.


* Philosophy *

Appearance/Design       : A lot of effort was put into making creating a
                          decent architecture. We are especially pleased
                          with the several light effects, and the
                          continuity of the used textures.
                          Not everything in this episode has a purpose.
                          Some things are just there for artistic or
                          architectural purposes. We think that is one of
                          the aspects that made the original DOOM levels
                          so good.

Traps                   : All levels have been designed in a way that
                          they do not contain places where you can get
                          trapped (at least not without providing you
                          with some kind of 'emergency exit').
                          Yet, should there be a place where you do get
                          stuck, and cannot get out except by using
                          'IDSPISPOPD', then let us know!

Secret Areas            : You do not have to get into the secret areas
                          to complete a level. Keys or switches to open
                          doors or areas are never located in secret areas.

                          All secret areas/doors are marked in some way
                          (for instance by giving it another light
                          level, or a slightly different texture).

Monsters                : We prefer quality over quantity, but on the
                          other hand we also want a WAD that offers lots
                          of action. We have tried to find a good balance
                          between quality and quantity.
                          We did make an exception though for
                          "Ultraviolence". Here there are an awfully lot
                          of monsters, and it should give those who like a
                          lot of fragging & fighting the challenge and
                          action you want (so we hope...).

If you like INFINITY, you'll most probably like SERENITY and ETERNITY as
well.

We have also release a sound-WAD with the complete collection of our
favourite Doom sounds. You should be able to get SERSOUND.WAD at the
same place/site as where you got this file (the same goes for the other
