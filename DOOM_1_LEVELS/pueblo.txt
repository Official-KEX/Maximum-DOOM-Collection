Description             : This was a "contract WAD" for a well known
                          Deathmatch tournament organizer who ultimately 
                          couldn't use it for business reasons.  The 
                          client's requirements were that it run on 1.2, be
                          pretty fast, have no nukage or other non-combat
                          hazards, and have the exit clearly marked but
                          hard to abuse.  My goals were that it look
                          memorable, play well, and have graded difficulty.
                          The result was influenced by my travels in Taos 
                          and the High Southwest.  I hope you like it.
