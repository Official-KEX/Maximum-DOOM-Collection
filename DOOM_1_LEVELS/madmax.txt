Description             : This level was designed solely for deathmatch
                          play. It is based around the MadMax style
                          chainsaw battle, with couple of other
                          weapons thrown in. Lots of warps for "The
                          Fly" effect, together with fast-paced play
                          makes this one a must for all deathmatch fans!
