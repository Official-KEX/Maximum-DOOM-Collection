Description             : This level is designed to provide lots of
             shooting action (hence the "oozi" pun).  There aren't a lot
             of puzzles, or secret doors that must be found to get to
             the end.  Nor are there any "death traps" or rooms with 18   
             Cyberdemons.  Just steady action.  And while there are lots of 
             bad guys to kill, an attempt was made to keep it realistic and 
             within the class of an original Doom level (i.e. this isn't just 
             another bunch of monsters and weapons and ammo haphazardly 
             strewn about every room).  I'd appreciate any and all comments/
             flames as to whether it succeeds.
             It has been beta tested by 2 players other than myself (with 
             a "thumbs up" from both), but only in single-player mode.  
             Multi-player and Deathmatch modes are provided, but not tested.
             The difficulty levels are also implemented.  In general, the
             harder the difficulty, the more monsters you get.  This level
             is designed to be challenging WITHOUT using the cheat keys!

             This is my first attempt at a Doom level built from scratch.
             Many, many, many! hours went into this level, the majority of
             which were spent learning various editors and the ins & outs
             of building levels in general.  At some point in time I'm sure
             I've done every wrong thing that can be done.  But it's been 
             a lot of fun and I hope you get as much fun out of playing it.

Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.0 & 5.1; DoomEd 2.5 beta 3; BSP 1.1
Known Bugs              : There are 1 or 2 spots where, when you walk over
                          them, the screen blacks out.  If you're moving at
                          any speed faster than an absolute dead crawl, it
                          only lasts a split second.  (Any ideas?)

Feel free to use this level as a base for new variations (I'd be flattered).
I only ask that you don't use the "RS_....." name as I plan to put out
additional levels with that naming convention.
