 This is the first of my 3 episodes in Rambutt's DOOM. Originally, I had 3 30
 level collections for DOOM 2 that I ran as 1 wad using D!Zone. But, that was
 before I figured out how to use to combine levels together. So, I went 
 through all 90 levels (out of nearly 1000 on D!Zone) and cut'em down to 15 !!
 This first episode has 8 modified levels from D!Zone, 2 modified id levels,
 and the upgraded version of my first original level.

 If you the name of the wad that any of these levels came from or who created
 them, drop me a line ! I want to credit to the people who did these !

 Also, I've added multi-player starts to all of these levels (deathmatch
 included !) and I also fixed some problems that I found. So, if any of these
 levels are yours, I hope you like what I did to them.

 Level        Wad            Description
  #1        Unknown          A building with a large outside area. Makes for
                             a nice first level, especially with a Baron at 
                             the start !
  #2        Unknown          I redid the ending of these one because of a
                             missing texture that looked really bad ! Look 
                             for those 2 Spider Masterminds !
  #3       DMHOUSE (?)       The DOOM House is back ! This time with the more
                             stuff !
  #4        Unknown          This is one HUGE room ! Lots of fun !
  #5        Unknown          One of the hardest levels I've ever seen !
  #6        H_HOTEL          This isn't the Motel 6, buddy !
  #7        Unknown          Come and explore an old run down warehouse.....
  #8         DOOM2           This is level 2 from DOOM 2, modified in my own
                             twisted style.
  #9         DOOM            This is (or was) e1m7 from DOOM 1. Also made in
                             my own style. (whatever that is !)
 #10        CHICKEN          I rearranged all of the stuff and added lots more
                             as well ! At least there's an exit somewhere !
 #11        NOMERCY          This is the Doom 2 version of my first original 
                             level. It's small, but you'll never live through 
                             it !

NOTES: All of these levels were originally designed for DOOM I, with the
exception of level 8.
Special thanks to Monolith (Kevin) for finding that nasty error in level 2
while we were playing on Dwango!

        levels to balance out with the 11 levels in the first part of DOOM 2.
