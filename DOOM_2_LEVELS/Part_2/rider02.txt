Description             : A VERY small DeathMatch level. But after playing
                          the same level for hours and hours, I decided
                          to leave it `AS-IS'. I hope you find it just
                          as fun.

Misc Game Info          : What you see is what you get in this level. No
                          secrets at all. I think this level shows the TRUE
                          skill of each player.
