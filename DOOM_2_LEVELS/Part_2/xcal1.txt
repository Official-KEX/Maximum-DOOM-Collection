wad tool used:  waded 1.83 reg.
coop:           sure...not a bad coop wad
dm:             was designed originally for dm...good for 3 or 4 players..
                might be a little too big for 2...you decide
weapons:        all weapons are included..even bfg for those 'bfg pussies'
misc.:          i didn't put a megasphere in here because i do not like 
                them....there are however both a soulsphere and a blue
                armor...so it will be just like a megasphere if you get 
                them both.

description:    I based this wad on the layout of my house...naturally,
                my house doesn't actually look like this wad....but it is
                roughly the same layout as my house.  There are a few 
                secrets...one is damn big...if you are able to find that 
                secret you will own deathmatch...there are two hidden warps
                that you will discover...i spent alot of time on this damn 
                thing so if you don't like it then just keep your comments
                to yourself...if you do like it, don't hesitate to talk 
                about it :)...other than that, I guess I'll just let you
                play the wad and see for yourself.  This is my FIRST wad, so
                don't blame me if you think it sucks...i don't think that 
                will happen though.  I will gladly accept any ideas or 
                constructive criticism which you think will improve this
                wad or just for future reference.
                Enjoy.
