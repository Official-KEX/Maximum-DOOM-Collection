Filename                : SPIFF_2.WAD
Author               :Spiff-     The wad master. He was the coauthor of the
				original spiffwad (worked with his brother)
				and is the creator of spiffwad 2 (actually 
				making the wad work and coming up with ideas).  
				He worked with and created many of the textures 
				,sounds, music, and basically everything else                  
				in the wad. 

CoAuthors            :C.C.C-     Spiff's brother he is the coauthor of the
				original spiffwad.  He played no part in the
				creation of spiff_2 but he deserves credit
				for all the work he did with the original
				spiffwad which was the basis for this wad.
		     
		     :DSTALKER-  Did not actually work with waded but he
				deserves credit because of the work he 
				did in three areas.  First of all many of
				the ideas in spiff_2.wad were Dstalker's.
				Second he found and modified many of the
				sounds in spiff_2.wad and third many of the
				kick ass textures were either found or created
				by him including the texture right in front
				of the exit.

Misc. Author Info       : We all completely KICK ASS

Description             : Designed for Deathmatch 2 for DOOM II                                                   
			  
Weapons:
--------
Everything you can dream of

Features:
---------
1. Cool new sounds, over 15 in all. We think that you will agree that the
new sounds completely kick ass.  Sounds include single barrel shotgun,
plasma shot, rocket shot, Item pickup sound, New slop sound, New pistol
sound, killer punching sound, new warp sound, and many more. 

2. New Killer Kick ASS music.  This music will rock your world.

3. New Textures.  One new animated texture.

4. Ok I will briefly go over the changes that have been made from spiffwad,
but I will not go over the original spiffwad, you must be familiar with 
it or figure things out for yourself (they are pretty obvious anyway).  

* First there are now two switches (near the door by the hidden room), these switches 
do two things.  One switch raises the floor in the hidden room crushing any
occupants, the other one obviously lowers the floor.  Two warnings though.  If
the person in the hidden room has 200 percent health and armor they will not
die but they will be trapped.  If you look at the hidden room you will see 
them and be able to shoot them even though they are in the ceiling. The second
note is that you will not be able to enter the hidden room if someone has 
raised the floor, you must lower it first.

* Did some asshole ever end the level before you were through?? No more!  There
is now a wall in front of the exit (with a awesome texture).  This wall can 
only be lowered by pressing on the wall that is marked exit (in the room that 
contains the hidden room).  What does this mean?? It means that no one will 
be able to exit the game by themselves, one person must press the switch and
the other must hit the exit.

* The rocket room, oh my this is hard to explain.  Ok basically the room is the
same except for the textures and a lot of switches.  When you warp in you can
click on the wall behind you to raise the warp to the ceiling making it 
inoperable.  Clicking on one of the Hitler faces will raise a wall in the 
middle of the room.  Clicking on the other Hitler face will lower the wall.
Note if you raise the wall and the warp a person on the other side is trapped.
If you run against the left hand wall you will be transported to a new room.
In this new room there are two warps.  Walking near the warps automatically
lowers the warp in the rocket room.  Walking on either of the new warps 
transports you to one of two positions in the rocket room.  I am sure this
all sounds horribly confusing to you, but just play and you will find out.

* The pink eyes in the center lower the other two walls in the center room
making game flow smoother. 

* There is now lava on top of the elevator in the center room that has the
megasphere on it.  

* There is a new titlescreen, look at it it kicks ass.

* There is now a hallway behind the old bfg allowing you to get the old bfg
(near the exit) without first starting in that position.

* New status bar, it completely wastes the old one.  Bet you wish you were
awesome enough to make it.  Look at the colors behind the faces as well, now
they are much more intense.

* Cool new sky texture

I may have forgotten something and this probably all sounds completely 
confusing, but I'm sure you will like the wad if you just try playing it.

You may not change this pwad.  This wad kicks ass and we don't want any
freaks going through and trying to make improvements to it (have a nice day)
:) You can take two or three of our sounds for a new wad, but don't overdo it.
You may not and I repeat not take any music or textures, too much time went
into them.

You MAY distribute this PWAD, provided you include this file, with
no modifications.  You may distribute this file in any electronic
format (BBS, Diskette, CD, etc) as long as you include this file 
intact.


Final Note:
-----------
  We personally think that this wad completely kicks ass, but that is probably
a slightly biased opinion (maybe not).  We'd love to hear from you if you 
actually have any meaningfull and helpfull suggestions.  If you have any
good criticism then send that too, but don't write just to say that you think
the wad sux because two things are obvious if you do 1. You are a delerious
fruit cake who is scheduled for commitment in a maximum security mental 
facility and 2. We are not going to accept your criticism because we tend
not to believe blind dumb animals.
