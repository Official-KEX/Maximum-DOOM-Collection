Description             : The Ultimate Challenge is full of Nasty Monsters.
			  And for the solo player may prove to much.  You can always
                          cheat.  There is plenty of weapons and ammo and even a few 
                          secret areas.  It is possible to win.   At the directory in
                          which you have doom2 located type doom2 -file UC.wad.
                          This should replace the regular map1 with the challenge of
                          a doomer's lifetime.  Good Luck
