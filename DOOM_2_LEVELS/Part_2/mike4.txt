Description             : This is a modified E1M1 from (Doom 1), the super
			  shotgun is in there for all you Deathmatch lovers.
			  Lots of good hiding places in this one, few elevators,
			  invisible walls. Totally amazing for Deathmatch!
			  This is for DOOM 2, this wad was done a few days
			  ago (Oct. 12/94) which I guess makes it
			  one of the first Doom 2 deathmatch wads.

Additional Credits to   : Swamper (an132016@anon.penet.fi) for putting up
			  with me and testing the wad to bits in heated
			  deathmatch duels.
