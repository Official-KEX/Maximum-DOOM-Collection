Description             : Lots of time and effort was put into the 
			  construction of this wad (and the entire series).
			  This is NOT some slapped together mess - Have 
			  fun :-)
			  
			  This is a Deathmatch Wad created for 
			  Doom 2.  All Weapons are available and no 
			  monsters are present. Ammo, health, armor,
			  and weapons are spread out to provide for
			  constant action.  This is the first in a 
			  series of deathmatch wads for Doom 2.  
			  
			  
Additional Credits to   : The authors of DoomCad and ID software.  I want
			  my Quake!
