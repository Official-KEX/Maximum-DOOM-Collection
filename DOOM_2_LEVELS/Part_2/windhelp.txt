       Just two tips for solo match play in case you get stuck.



Where is the damned RED key?!

Search for a secret door along the inner wall of the outer hallway.

How the hell do I survive at the Ultraviolence Level?

 Don't spend any extra time trying to get the BFG at the start! Move quickly
 to the outer hall and keep on the move around it. Pause VERY briefly at a 
 window to allow monsters in the center of the arena to get a  shot off then
 get back on your wheels. Repeat this as you zoom around the outer hall. This
 tactic will create alot of monster crossfire which tends to  help thin them
 out. Don't kill the spiderdemon, he will eventually die from the other monster's
 retaliations, in the meantime he will take out quite a few monsters for you.
 As you clear out windowed rooms, zip in and get the  health. If all else fails,
 clear one of towers of badguys then hole up in it and thin out the Cacos from
 there. If you are still unable to complete it, playback ultwin.lmp with your
 favorite Wad manager and it will help. Enjoy!
