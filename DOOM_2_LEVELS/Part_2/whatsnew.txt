Whats new in v1.1 of WORLDDM.WAD
--------------------------------

- Mancubus now fires chicken's inside of those flame balls or whatever
you want to call them <g> It works very good actually, and is fun to
watch :-)

- Included a seperate Sound PWAD called WORLDSND.WAD, which is just some
new sounds for some of the graphic's replacement's in WORLDDM.WAD. It's
not easy trying to find those perfect sounds you know :-)

- Imps, Demon's, Lost Soul's, Cacodemon's, Baron of Hell and Cyberdemon
now have new graphic replacements :-) I think you'll especially love the
Cyberdemon graphics <g> I'd hate to run into this dude playing DOOM
deathmatch at 3 in the morning <g>
