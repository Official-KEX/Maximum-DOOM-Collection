Misc. Author Info       : This is NOT my first WAD, but I finally
                          decided to release something I've made.
                          This is my second release of something I
                          have written, and I'll probably put more out
                          soon.

Description             : If you like Doom ][ Map 7, you'll LOVE this.
                          The setting is an old Greek temple, and you've
                          got a large arena to roam and gather weapons
                          to blast your opponent away.  There is only
                          one megasphere, in the center of the map.
                          Drop the lift and you got it, and stay on
                          the lift for the ultimate view of the
                          level. (Just watch your back!)
