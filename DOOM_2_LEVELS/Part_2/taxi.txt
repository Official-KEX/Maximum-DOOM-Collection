	This wad is designed for Deathmatch only.  If you use IDDT
you will see two rooms near "left" area, and two near "right" area,
seperated by a door.  These doors are tagged to lines in the
opposite sections and are designed to help you find your opponent.
If you hear one of these doors, you know where your opponent is.
Also, "star" in middle drops when someone is in the "ammo" room.
Use an editor to see what I mean.
