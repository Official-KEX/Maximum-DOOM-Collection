   This is the source code for WinTex 3.4, a tool to
  customise DOOM and HERETIC WAD files under windows.

  copyright (c) 1995 Olivier Montanuy (montanuy@lannion.cnet.fr) 
 
  It's in visual basic 3.0 plus C extensions.
  the needed DLL is included.
   
  If you intend to reuse a large part of this code, or release
  a new version of WinTex, you will have to keep me informed, in
  order to avoid problems with my own releases.
  
  This copyrighted program can be reused freely, so long as I get
  some credit (well, me and the guys that helped me, indeed).

 Remark:
  this Visual Basic code could certainly be improved a lot, but I have
  no time for it, at the moment.
