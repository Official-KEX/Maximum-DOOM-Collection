Description             : This is an 8 level collection of Deathmatch
                          levels for DOOM2.  Compiled from the works
                          of myself (Tim) and my fellow author (Jason).
                          These levels represent a wide range of tastes
                          in deathmatch play, from the ultra-small levels
                          to the large, hunt-em-down levels (but not too 
                          large).

Additional Credits to   : Many playtesters, too many too mention by name.
                          You know who you are.

                          Kenneth S. Forte for some of the great sound FX.

Description             : This PWAD is a mod of the original E1M1 mission
                          in DOOM that has been revamped for OPTIMUM
                          DOOM2 deathmatch play.  Yea, I know, you're 
                          thinking "Oh great, another E1M1 mod...", but
                          trust me, this one is GREAT for DM. Over 30 hours of 
                          playtesting on a 4 player network has contributed
                          to making this level a superior Deathmatch PWAD.

* About CITADEL2.WAD *

  Citadel II - Citadel of Power is my fifth PWAD, the first one I have
designed primarily for Deathmatch play.  Considerable time has gone into
making this level a very playable Deathmatch PWAD.  Many additions and
modifications were made to the level after extensive playtesting in
2, 3 and 4 player deathmatches.  A fair amount of time has also been
spent in making the level look good, so I'm hoping it will be a pleasure
to play.  As an afterthought, I also added in a few choice sounds to make
Deathmatch more fun.

  There are several tricks to CITADEL2 that you will only notice and make 
use of in multi-player play.  They are described below:

  Symmetry:

    Citadel II is symmetrical by design, to keep the layout simple and
    easy to learn.  Whatever exists on one side of the map will exist
    on the other.  This goes for textures, rooms, lighting, items, and
    monsters.

  Lighting effects:
    
    Notice that there are two cubbyholes to the left and right of the
    large central room.  The lights in these rooms flash on and off
    rapidly if someone is running up the left or right staircases,
    respectively.  Also, if the light flashes then remains dark, the
    marine has run down the stairs.  If the light flashes and remains
    lit, the marine has run up the stairs.  This assists you in locating
    you foe from inside this large room (I call it the AnteChamber).

    There is a cave-like area on the south side of the map, with the
    BFG on a platform.  There is a left and right door on either end to
    allow access, leading from a room with a lit platform in either corner.
    If a marine jumps out the door to get the BFG, the lit platform in the
    room on the opposite side of the map will flash.  This is to warn and
    alert marine of an enemy running for the most powerful weapon in the
    game.

  Sniper spot doors:
 
    From the AnteChamber you can see two small platforms obstructed by
    grates.  These grates are initially covered by walls which lower when
    you enter the AnteChamber.  The doors leading to these sniper spots 
    are opened by moving towards the left and right lower rooms.  Knowing
    this, you can tell which direction you foe is headed in the south
    portion of the map.

  Multiplayer exit:
  
    In the Marble Room is a section of wall that lowers when you step on
    the central platform, exposing this room to the AnteChamber.  When
    this happens, two switches are exposed, either will lower a lift on
    the far side of the map.  The lift is by the rocket launcher, between
    the two single player exit doors.  Behind this lift is the end level
    switch.  Note that in multiplayer mode, the two single player exits
    are obstructed.  This prevents someone from ending the level without
    consent of all duelling parties.

  Extra weapons:

    There are more weapons in multiplayer mode, but the amount of ammo
    is the same in multi or single player.

* Final Notes *

  There are a couple of secrets too, and if you can get to them before
the other guys do, you will have a big advantage.  Ill let you find
these out for yourself.
  
  Last but not least, the skill level feature has been utilized to
provide players with a different flavour of Deathmatch depending upon
the difficulty level you are playing on.  For those of you who play
with finesse, try skill 1 or 2, where you will have to shoot straight
and use your ammo wisely.  If brute force is more your style, then go
for skill level 4 or 5, where plasma, rockets and megasheres abound.  
I prefer skill 3 myself, a nice mix that keeps the game flowing.
  
  Citadel II was designed for the -ALTDEATH parameter, but regular
Deathmatch rules work OK too.  If your a sadist, try playing with the
-RESPAWN parameter on skill 1 or 2 (or higher - ouch!).

Description             : Very complex, many secrets, requires a little
                          bit of learning, but worth the time.  For the
                          dedicated and veteran deathmatchers looking
                          for something a little different.

                          Most of the weapons are in the secret areas
                          and require you risking your ass a bit.  If
                          you have a little bit too much health, go for 
                          the plasma rifle ;).

                          A quick check of the complete map will explain
                          the title of the wad.
                          
                          Note: All of the "blocks" in the main room have
                          something inside them.

                        : Aesthetics            : 4

Description:              I hate the BFG.  No skill involved with it. 
                          Some players like the mass destruction it
                          causes, so I created this level with those
                          players in mind, and it's actually quite fun.
                          This level was designed to be small, fast and
                          furious.  Non-stop fraggin action, even with 
                          2 players.

Additional Credits to   : Steve Silvester and his friend James for
