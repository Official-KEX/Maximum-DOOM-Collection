Misc. Author Info       : Hey, I'm at it again with yet another deathmatch
                          level for DOOM II...This ones my personal favorite,
                          so far...even better than 30. Wait around for my
                          first single player wad of a subway station if you
                          like my work...
                          And remember--

                          I AM THE ETERNAL WAD-MASTER!!


Description             : My original goal was to try to draw out a level all
                          in 1 sitting, then do all the sectors at once, ect.
                          It turned out to have a kind of great uniformity
                          to it...as you can see, unlike most of my earlier
                          work the level kind of looks like a circle instead
                          of a straight line...it's spread out. Look for the
                          few glitches in the walls, as if you walk through
                          them during deathmatch, it's a great place to hide.
                          It looks really cool to see the other player leap
                          out of the wall, BFG in hand...
                       
                          
Additional Credits to   : I.D., for being cool and writing the game...
