Misc. Author Info       : Spends way too much time playing DOOM ][. WAY too 
                          much. Trust me. 
Description             : I was looking through all the textures in DOOM ][,  
                          and the Bloodfalls/Slimefalls textures really jumped 
                          out at me. "Design a level based around us" is what 
                          they said. So I found myself devoting large potions of 
                          time that might otherwise be spent on useless tasks
                          (such as studying, eating, or sleeping) building and
                          testing Pitfalls. It was originally going to be just
                          the first one, the Bloodfalls, but then it was 
                          suggested that I build a sequel. So I did and called
                          them Pitfalls.
