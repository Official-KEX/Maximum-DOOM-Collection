Copy all of the enclosed files into your doom2 directory.

You will need a copy of dehacked2.0 to load the wolf.deh into your doom.exe
file.  Be sure to backup your doom.exe file prior to patching the file.
To patch the file type 'dehacked -load wolf.deh' at the c:\doom2 prompt.
The wad will run just fine without the dehacked patch if you don't have
dehacked2.0.

If your doom2 is not located in c:\doom2, you will have to edit
the r2wolf.bat file and change the reference to c:\doom2 to the location
you have your game.

The following files are located in this zip file.

readit.txt              this file
