Misc. Author Info       : Used my own editor.  It's powerful and easy
                          to use, but isn't polished enough for general
                          release.  Maybe someday....

Description             : This is a DeathMatch frag fest!  Lots of weapons,
                          good layout, room to run, and a few teleporters
                          for a quick getaway.  Even a few ambush spots
                          for real fun!

Additional Credits to   : DEU authors (I'm using their find sector routine
                          in my editor).
