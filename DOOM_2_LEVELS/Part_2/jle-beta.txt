Thanks for beta testing this wad.  It's greatly appreciated.

Please send feedback via e-mail to jlelson@utdallas.edu by March 30th.
All those who response will be credited upon release of the final version.
Please feel free to offer any comments/criticisms/suggestions.  Also, please
send some multiplayer lmps!  Thanks.

This is a deathmatch only wad.  There are 3 different configurations
based upon the difficulty level:

1 or 2: a boxing fight.  Only armor and health bonus.  No weapons given.

3: the slaughter house.  Combatants are also furnished with chainsaws.

4 or 5: gore fest.  Two berserk packs and 1 pump shotgun are also provided,
      but there's precious little ammo. Make it count. :)

There are only 4 deathmatch starts, but each one is protected by a one-way
      door.  No cheap frags.  Every one starts out with a pistol and a green
      armor, and, on skill 3 - 5, a chainsaw.  

BTW, there is a megasphere, but it's gonna cost ya to get it.  Also, the
exit is cooperative: the switch is in the room where the megasphere is.
