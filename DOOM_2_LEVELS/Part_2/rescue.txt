                          Gal Mac Porter told you it was the last mission you
                          had to complete. But he forget to tell you 
                          something very important. He ordered your brother
                          to go back to 15th century in the Carpathian
                          Mountains, and try to strengthen the rebels by 
                          killing some more Hell Order agents, In spite of 
                          his promise to keep your brother away from these 
                          time-travel and risky missions. He is too young to
                          die.
                            Coming back to your era, he said that he couldn't
                          do anything else, and that this mission was a matter
                          of life and deaf for your rebelion group. He added
                          that unfortunately he had no news about your brother
                          for days. So, you to decide to go back there and try
                          to rescue your brother. You hope he is still alive
                          and could killed many Hell Order agents.
                            But a bad thinking borns in your mind : Why did
                          Gal Mac Porter give such a dangerous mission to 
                          your brother in spite of his promise, what kind of
                          reason did he found ?
