Misc. Author Info       : Looking forward to playing my registered
                          version of Heretic.

Description             : Wadfthr.WAD is a collection of deathmatch
                          levels for Doom 2.  It was optimized for
                          the alternate deathmatch rules.  There are
                          no "network-play only" items, so what you
                          see is what you get.

If you read the text files in AUTHOR.ZIP, you'll see that some of the

Please send compliments/feedback to my E-mail address above. I'd like to

I am working on a smaller sequel to this WAD file.  Please feel free 
to point me towards other neat Deathmatch WADs.  Just tell me the 
location to download the files from or post the WADs on ftp.cdrom.com.

I think this WAD would work really well with Heretic.  Anybody interested
in converting it over?

Unzip the file labeled AUTHOR.ZIP for more information about the levels 
listed below.  The information in the text files may differ from the actual
level because I've modified the WADs.  My modifications consisted of texture 
changes, texture alignment, bug fixes, weapon/goodie re-allocation, different 
monsters, and the addition of exits and/or exit signs.  Each level required
varying degrees of modification.  You'll have to download each WAD in its 
original format to view the extent of my changes.  All of these levels can 
be found at ftp.cdrom.com.

Send E-mail to the authors if you like their work.

                              LEVEL INFO

Type "IDBEHOLD A" in single player mode if you'd like to see all the secret 
areas on a particular level.  It will give you a complete automap of the 
level.  Level 12 has an exception to this rule.

Locked doors requiring keys (and the keys themselves) were removed from
all the levels except level 16.  Deathmatchers automatically receive all
the keys, so it didn't make any sense to penalize single players who are
examining the WAD file.  I kept the keys on level 16 because they add to
the charm of the level.


Level 2

     This level has multiple areas.  Each area features a different challenge.
     The only weird feature is the maze.  The red and blue lines indicate
     invisible walls.  You can shoot through blue walls.  Red walls block
     your fire.  

     Each teleporter in the "temple" is linked to the other pads and itself.
     Where you end up depends on where you cross on a particular side (left,
     right, middle, etc).  I don't know the pattern; but who cares?  It would 
     only spoil the surprise!   :-)


Level 4

     This level should look very familiar.  The only major changes are 
     the option to jump out of the large window by the former blue skull key 
     and the ability to open the narrow "teleporter tube" more than once.  
     I love a good footrace!  :-)


Level 5

     To exit the arena, pull the levers behind the north and south doors.
     This will reveal another set of levers in the eastern and western walls.  
     The levers in the eastern wall will raise a section of floor adjacent 
     to the arena's center column.  The levers in the western wall will lower 
     the center column, revealing a plasma gun and a row of buttons on the 
     raised floor section.  Push the buttons to end the level.


Level 7

     This is E3M3 from original Doom.  The secret area lift in the wooden
     room can now be used multiple times.


Level 9

     Jump into the quarry if you've got too many Revenant missles following
     you.  The missles will slam into the quarry walls when you run through
     a narrow passageway.


Level 10

     There is nothing wrong with the center lift on this level.  The super
     shotgun is supposed to be difficult to get.


Level 12

     There's a concealed ambush point on the right side of the center 'O'
     which doesn't show up on the automap.  Aren't you glad you read this 
     file?


Level 15

     There's a secret level exit to the right of the regular level exit.  
     Shoot the wall to open it up.


Level 16

     This level was designed to look like a house.  It has a few sneaky
     secret areas.  Check out the medicine cabinet in the bathroom or step
     into the fireplace.  Push against the refrigerator to "open" it - just
     watch out for that hot stove!

     The level has one teleporter.  It's in the 2nd story room with the big
     bay window.  The teleporter is in the left hand corner of the window. 
     It's supposed to simulate jumping through the window.


Level 24
     
     There are three secret areas on this level.  Two on the eastern wall
     and one on the western wall.  The western wall is easy - just push
     against the wall in the correct spot.  The first door in the eastern
     wall (the one closest to the 'TN') will also open if you push on it.  
     The second door requires you to push the wooden gargoyle head in the 
     center stockade.  Once you press the button, you only have a few 
     seconds to get through the door before it closes.


Level 29

     Two of the columns on this level can be dropped for 3 seconds.  You
     can only do this on ONE side of the columns.

     The exit switch is in the Cacodemon house.  There's a "backdoor" into
     the house.


Level 30

     I've eliminated all the nukage areas on E1M1.  You can jump through 
     the windows to the outside area with the rocket launcher.  I added 
     a teleporter in the exit room which transports you to the computer 
     center.  The secret ledge overlooking the former zig-zag nukage room 
     can now be accessed from the secret room guarded by the imp.  I 
     eliminated the trigger requiring players to cross a specific linedef 
     in order to lower the elevator which takes you to the secret ledge.


Level 31

     There's a secret snipers nest behind each revenant platform which 
     can be reached from the top of the platform.  Their relative positions
     are 10 & 2 o'clock if you're standing in the center of the platform 
     facing the wall.  Use the cheat code described above if you can't find 
     the secret areas.  There's a secret teleporter in each snipers nest 
     which you'll have no difficulty finding once you get into the nest.


Level 32

     The secret areas for this level are far too difficult to describe.
     Use the cheat codes and experiment in single player mode.  The brown
     wall texture with a lamp and the metal wall texture with a voltage
     symbol identify secret doors & triggers. 


I hope you enjoy playing this WAD file as much as I've enjoyed making it.
