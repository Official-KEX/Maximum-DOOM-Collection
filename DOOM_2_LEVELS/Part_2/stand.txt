Misc. Author Info       : A doomer since Dec 10th, I can usually be found 
                          on the irc channel #doom. I'm also the author of
                          swmusfx4 and headlong.wad.

Description             : BTW:  THIS WAD IS FOR DOOM 2 
                          This wad is based on HEADLONG.WAD but I made many
                          improvements and I think you'll find it's quite
                          different.  It's got (as far as I know) every 
                          weapon in the game and is intended for deathmatch
                          with no monsters (only way to play!).  I did add
                          co-op starts and some monsters but I didn't spend
                          much time on that.  I took advantage of some of the
                          new textures from Doom 2 such as the panelling and
                          bookshelves.  The exit is easy to reach and very
                          visible because I expect in deathmatch it will make
                          it easier for you.  (why bother with co-op exits? :)
                          Anyway, I can't think of anything else to say, except
                          maybe that if you're wondering where I got the name
                          , it's from the best book of all time, `The Stand'
                          by Stephen King and it seemed as good a name as
                          any! :)

Known Bugs              : There is one spot where I just could not get the 
                          door to work both ways.  I tried every possible
                          linedef action but that sucker wants to stay closed.
                          :).  Looking at it, it might be better that way
                          anyway but you'll have to decide.  (it's the door
                          by the exit)
