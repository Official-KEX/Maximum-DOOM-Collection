* Play Information *
This WAD is designed for 2 on 2 deathmatch. To encourage
co-operation within teams, you will require your team-mate to
help you to obtain the rocket-laucher, both super-shotguns and
the mega-sphere.

This WAD requires 3 players to exit. It's pretty straight forward:
the first player opens the first exit door (left-most) and presses
the switch, the second and third players do the same to the next
two doors. The switch behind the 3rd exit door ends the level.
