Description             : Actually my fourth DeathMatch WAD, but I kinda
                          like it as a warm-up level. Pretty small, looks
                          good (we'll I like it anyway ;)) and increase the
                          frag count somewhat.

Misc Game Info          : I would suggest you play it by yourself first, and
                          figure out how to get the MEGA-SPHERE. If you
                          can do this, you have a big advantage.

Additional Credits to   : My DeathMatch partner, he knows who he is!  8-)
                          ID Software. Keep 'em comin guys!
