Description             : This is Wad is a straight-forward you-against-them
                          commando sort of thing.  This wad is fast action and
			  it will take speed and intelligence to complete it...
                          ...well, maybe just speed.
                          
                          A friend and I tried a co-op mode and it did run a
                          little slow because the amount of creatures that are 
                          present... and we were using 486/66 computers with
                          14.4 baud modems to play.

                          Anyway, give it a go and tell me what you think.
