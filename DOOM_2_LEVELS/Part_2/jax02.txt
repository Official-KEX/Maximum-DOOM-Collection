Misc. Author Info       : Seattle, Washington, Complete Loser, No life.

Description             : This is my second attempt at wad construction. This
                          wadfile is pretty straight forward...find the redkey
                          and get the hell out of dodge!!!!!

                          This file is no fun if played in god-mode so, try to
                          play it without all of the cheat codes...I did put in
                          enough weapons for you to get the job done so, good
                          luck and may the force be with you.
                       

                          I also included a *.LMP recording of this wad and I 
                          was doing ok for awhile but I made a stupid mistake and
                          got nailed...see if you can do better!!!
                          
                                       
                          Anyway, give it a go and tell me what you think.
