    8) - Some how the automap is functional 8).  I used warm13 instead of 
        warm11 and everything maps including the secret walls.
    8( - After using warm13 the very next time the automap would not 
        function correctly.  Use a map editor for preview.
        
    8) - The following is a list of what candy is in the PWAD:
        1 BFG                           1 boxes of shells

        8)   - Secret Stuff. hmmm. Like I siad LOOK. I have read most design FAQs.
          - Hint..I kept it light cause of the faulty automap.

        8) Played with the texture alignments - Somethings just sparkle ;)
        
        8) Hope you enjoy as much as I had fun making it
        
        8) Lowered the amount of available ammo - should make for quick frags

        8( It may slow down alittle if your atop any of the large staircases
                and looking into the Big room.  Lower your screen size or 
                choose low detail. OR don't hangout there!
