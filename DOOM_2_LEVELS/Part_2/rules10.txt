*==========================================================================*

I.  The competition's fundamental rules.
    
    A. Use of cheat codes and/or the -turbo, -altdeath, and/or -deathmatch
        parameters will automatically disqualify any entry.  However, the
        use of a "mouse spinner" or "keyboard spinner" is allowed.
    
    B. In order for an entry to be valid, the lmp, also know as a demo,
        which it contains must meet the following conditions.
       
       1. Be generated by using an unaltered version of id Software's
           doom2.exe to record, by means of the -record parameter, one or
           more human beings, and only human beings, actually playing.  Once
           so generated, the only alterations of a lmp that will not
           disqualify an entry are:
          
          a. Changing the version number.
          
          b. Removal of a portion of the lmp that records player movements
              and/or actions that occurred after the exit switch was
              triggered.
       
       2. Be a lmp in which the contestant or all the contestants listed in
           the "entry form" for the "solo" or "co-op" entry, respectively,
           actually controlled said lmp's player(s).
    
    C. Entries in each of the competition's categories will be ranked
        according to the "finish time."
       
       1. In the competition, "% Kills" will not be used to determine the
           ranking of a valid entry unless it represents the same "finish
           time" as one or more entries in the same category.
          
       2. In the event that one or more valid entries in the same category
           represent the same "finish time", said entries will then be
           ranked according to "% Kills": an entry that represents the
           greater "% Kills" will be ranked higher than one which represent
           a lesser "% Kills."
       
       3. In the event that one or more valid entries in the same category
           represent the same "finish time" and the same "% Kills", the
           ranking of said entries will be determined by the "time & date
           stamp" of said entries in the /pub/idgames/lmps/H2HMud directory
           at ftp.cdrom.com: an entry that has an earlier "time & date
           stamp" will be ranked higher than an entry that has a later one.
          
       4. In the "solo", i.e., single player, categories:
          
          a. Your player must still be alive after the "exit switch" is
              triggered.  (It is possible for a player to die at the same
              time the "exit switch" is triggered.)
          
          b. The "finish time" will be the time reported on the statistics
              screen that is displayed after the level has been exited by
              triggering the "exit switch."
          
          c. The "% Kills" will be the percentage reported on the statistics
              screen that is displayed after the level has been exited by
              triggering the "exit switch."
       
       5. In the "co-op", i.e., multi-player, categories:
          
          a. When and/or how often any of the teams players die will be not
              a factor in the eligibility nor the ranking of entries.
          
          b. The "finish time" will be time from the moment that the lmp
              begins to the moment that the "exit switch" is triggered.
              Since the finish time is not reported on the statistics screen
              in multi-player mode, the "finish time" reported on the
              completed "entry form" (H2H_form.txt which is contained in H2H-
              pack.zip) should be determined by playing the lmp and timing
              it from the moment the players raise their pistols till the
              moment that the exit switch is triggered.  Officially, the
              finish time will be determined as the amount of time, rounded
              up to the nearest whole second, that elapses between the
              beginning of the lmp and the time at which the exit switch is
              triggered.
          
          c. The "% Kills" will be the sum of the percentages for each
              player reported on the statistics screen that is displayed
              after the level has been exited by triggering the "exit
              switch."
    
    D. In order for an entry to be valid, the lmp that it contains must
        allow the statistics screen "tic-off", and must continue to display
        it for at least 5 more seconds after the final statistics have been
        displayed.
    
    E. In order for an entry to be valid, the lmp that it contains must
        begin on the level specific to the category in which it is entered
        and consist of one and only one attempt, successful or otherwise, to
        trigger the level's "exit switch."  In order words, the player(s)
        must begin from the level "scratch", i.e., with "100% Health", "0%
        Armor", a pistol and "50 Ammo"; and the lmp must consist of only one
        "run" which in the case of "solo" categories entails that the player
        cannot die at any point in the lmp.
    
    F. In order for an entry to be valid, the lmp that it contains must not
        be "paused" at any time.  Any entry which contains a lmp that gives
        evidence of the usage of the game's "pause" function will be
        invalid.
    
    G. Entered lmps may be recorded by using versions 1.666, 1.7, 1.7a, 1.8
        or 1.9 of Doom II(TM).  However, only version 1.9 lmps will be
        considered valid unless the entry was submitted prior to the
        official beginning of the competition: May 5, 1995.
       
       1. Note Well: Included in H2H-pack.zip is a lmp utility which can
           change a lmp's version: lmput150.zip.
    
    H. There is no limit on the number of entries in any or all categories
        that a contestant or "team" may submit for entry.  However, any
        contestant's or "team's" valid entry which represents a faster
        "finish time" than a previous or subsequent valid entry in the same
        category will be officially considered to be his/her or their,
        respectively, only valid entry for that category.  In the event that
        a contestant or "team" has submitted two or more valid entries in
        the same category which represent the same "finish time", the one
        which represents the greatest "% Kills" will be considered to be
        his/her or their, respectively, only valid entry.  If two or more
        valid entries in a category by the same contestant or "team"
        represent the same finish time and "% Kills", then the most recent
        entry will be officially considered to be his/her or their,
        respectively, only valid entry.
    
    I. In order for an entry to be valid, it's "entry form" must indicate a
        valid e-mail address through which the contestant(s) can both
        receive and send e-mail from and to, respectively, valid Internet e-
        mail addresses on the date that the entry is submitted and all the
        dates following said entry's submission until July 20, 1995.
    
    J. The lmp, "entry form" and zip filenames must all have the same name,
        except for the extension, which complies with the official naming
        convention which for "solo" entries is MMmSSiii, and for "co-op"
        entries is MMmSSx#T where MM and SS represent the minutes and
        seconds, respectively, of the entries "finish time" in the range of
        00 through 99 and 00 through 59, respectively, iii represents the
        contestant's initials, # refers to the number of players, and T
        represents an initial to signify the "team's" name.
       
       1. Some examples:
          
          a. 1 min 9 sec by A Doom God: 01m09adg.lmp, 01m09adg.txt,
              01m09adg.zip.
          
          b. 59 min 32 sec by Just A Lamer: 59m32jal.lmp, etc.
          
          c. 2 min 15 sec by 2-player "team", We're The Best: 02m15x2w.lmp,
              etc.
          
          d. 49 min 7 sec by 4-player "team", Cannon Fodder: 49m07x4f.lmp,
              etc.
          
    K. In order for an entry to be valid, it must be successfully submitted
        before the deadline to one of the places listed in Section IV.
       
       1. It is preferable that all entries be sent to ftp.cdrom.com via
           FTP.
           
          a. Any entry submitted to ftp.cdrom.com which is not sent via FTP
              to the /pub/idgames/lmps/incoming directory will be
              disqualified.
          
          b. An entry may be uploaded one of the two others sites listed in
              Section IV.
       
       2. An accurately completed "entry notification" (notify.txt which is
           contained in H2H-pack.zip) must be e-mailed to the competition's
           statistician, Jim Elson, at jelson@conline.com as well as to Mark
           Gundy, who is responsible for prize distribution, at mag8@aol.com
           before the end of the competition which is specified in Section
           I.O.
          
          a. Note Extremely Well: it is very important that the "entry
              notification" be successfully e-mailed to both Jim Elson and
              Mark Gundy at their respective e-mail addresses indicated in
              Section I.K.2. before the entry is sent to ftp.cdrom.com via
              FTP or uploaded to either of the two other sites listed in
              Section IV.  The first "entry notification form" successfully
              e-mailed to and received by Mark Gundy at mag8@aol.com for a
              submitted entry will be the only one that will be construed as
              authentic.  (It is possible that someone could notice a
              contestant's entry and attempt to send in another "entry
              notification form" which stated that said contestant's e-mail
              and/or shipping address has changed and asking that said
              contestant's "prize set" be shipped to a different address.)
    
    L. A contestant can be awarded a maximum of one and only one "solo"
        "prize set" regardless of how many "solo" "prize sets" his/her
        "solo" entries make him/her eligible to be awarded.
       
       1. However, multiple wins will still count towards both a
           contestant's as well as his/her region's point totals in the
           "Home of the DoomGods" part of the competition: see Section V.
           for more information.
       
       2. Unless a contestant specifies his/her "solo prize set preference"
           by utilizing the "solo prize set preference option" in the "Prize
           Preference Section" of his/her accurately and unambiguously
           completed "entry notification form", which is successfully e-
           mailed to and received by Mark Gundy at mag8@aol.com, for his/her
           most recent entry which makes him/her eligible to be awarded a
           "solo" "prize set", said contestant will awarded the "solo"
           "prize set" which has the greatest market value based upon the
           manufacturer's suggested retail price in U.S. dollars which is
           indicated in Section III.A.
       
       3. In the event that two or more of the "solo" "prize sets" that a
           contestant is eligible to be awarded have the same market value,
           the contestant will be awarded the "solo" "prize set" for the
           most recent of said entries unless the contestant's "solo prize
           set preference" indicated in the most recent of said entries is
           both valid, as per Section I.L.2, and germane.
       
       4. In the event that a "solo" "prize set" which a contestant is
           eligible to be awarded is not awarded to said contestant because
           the awarding of said "solo" "prize set" would violate the "only
           one 'solo' 'prize set' per contestant" rule, the contestant whose
           entry in the category for which said "prize set" is designated
           represents the next best entry, as per Section I.C.1., will then
           be eligible to be awarded said "prize set" instead of the "solo"
           "prize set", if any, which he/she was eligible to be awarded.
           This rule will be applied recursively.
          
          a. In order to help clarify the intent of this rule, consider the
              following hypothetical.  Able, Baker, Charlie, David, and
              Eliot submitted entries in category X which won 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
              4th, and 5th places, respectively.  Additionally, Able won 1st
              place in category Y, Charlie won 1st place in category Z, and
              neither David nor Eliot submitted 1st, 2nd or 3rd places
              entries in any of the "prize set" categories.  Thus, Able and
              Charlie are eligible to be awarded two "solo" "prize sets"
              each while Baker is only eligible to be awarded one.  It is
              further hypothesized that Able is awarded the "solo" prize set
              which he was eligible to be awarded for his 1st place entry in
              category Y and Charlie is awarded the "solo" prize set which
              he was eligible to be awarded for his 1st place entry in
              category Z.  Therefore, the "solo" "prize sets" designated for
              the 1st, 2nd and 3rd place entries in category X will now be
              awarded to Baker, David, and Eliot, respectively.
    
    M. A "team", the set of contestants who controlled the players in an
        entered lmp, can be awarded a maximum of one and only one "co-op"
        "prize set", which consists of a number of "prize units" equal to
        the number of players, regardless of how many "co-op" "prize sets"
        the "team's" "co-op" entries make it eligible to be awarded.  (Note
        that even if the very same set of individual submit "co-op" entries
        under more than one "team" name, for official purposes, each of the
        said "teams" will be considered as one and the same "team".)
        
       1. However, multiple wins will still count towards both a
           contestant's as well as his/her region's point totals in the"
           Home of the DoomGods" part of the competition: see Section V. for
           more information.
       
       2. In contrast to "solo" "prize sets", "co-op" "prize sets" are first
           awarded to "teams."  In the event that a "team" is eligible to be
           awarded more than one "co-op" "prize set", said "team" will be
           awarded the "co-op" "prize set" which has the greatest market
           value based upon the manufacturer's suggested retail price in
           U.S. dollars which is indicated in Section III.A.
       
       3. In the event that two or more of the greatest market value "co-op"
           "prize sets" that a "team" is eligible to be awarded have the
           same market value, the "team" will be awarded the "co-op" "prize
           set" which the most recent of the "team's" said entries.
       
       4. In the event that a "co-op" "prize set" which a "team" is eligible
           to be awarded is not awarded to said "team" because the awarding
           of said "co-op" "prize set" would violate the "only one 'co-op'
           'prize set' per 'team'" rule, the "team" whose entry in the
           category for which said "prize set" is designated represents the
           next best entry, as per Section I.C.1., will then be eligible to
           be awarded said "prize set" instead of the "co-op" "prize set",
           if any, which the "team" was eligible to be awarded.  This rule
           will be applied recursively.
       
       5. A contestant can be awarded a maximum of one and only one "co-op"
           "prize unit" regardless of how many "prize units" his/her
           "teams'" and/or "team's" "co-op" entries make him/her eligible to
           be awarded.
          
          a. Each contestant who is a member of a "team" that has been
              awarded a "co-op" "prize set" is thereby eligible to be
              awarded one and only one "co-op" "prize unit" of said "co-op"
              "prize set."  Any contestant who is eligible to be awarded
              said "prize unit" will be awarded said "prize unit" provided
              that he/she is not eligible to be awarded more than one "co-
              op" "prize unit."  In the event that a contestant is eligible
              to be awarded more than one "co-op" "prize unit" as a
              consequence of being a member of more than one "team" that has
              awarded a "co-op" "prize set", said contestant will be awarded
              the "co-op" "prize unit" which has the greatest market value
              based upon the manufacturer's suggested retail price in U.S.
              dollars which is indicated in Section III.A.
          
          b. In the event that two or more of the greatest market value "co-
              op" "prize units" that a contestant is eligible to be awarded
              have the same market value, said contestant will be awarded
              the "co-op" "prize unit" which the most recent of the "teams'"
              two or more entries that thereby made him/her eligible to be
              awarded said "co-op" "prize units."
    
    N. The "entry notification form" for a "solo" entry for which a
        contestant has been awarded a "solo" "prize set" must contain a
        valid e-mail address, since upon being awarded a "prize set, an e-
        mail missive will be e-mailed to him/her at the address specified in
        said "entry notification form."  If an e-mail response from said
        contestant is not received by Mark Gundy at mag8@aol.com on or
        before July 20, 1995, said contestant will forfeit the "prize set"
        that he/she has been awarded.
    
    O. The "entry notification form" for a "co-op" entry for which a
        contestant has been awarded a "co-op" "prize unit" must contain a
        valid e-mail address for each of the "team's" members, since upon
        being awarded a "co-op" "prize unit", an e-mail missive will be e-
        mailed to him/her at the address specified in said "entry
        notification form."  If an e-mail response from said contestant to
        mag8@aol.com is not received by Mark Gundy on or before July 20,
        1995, said contestant will forfeit the "prizes unit" which he/she
        has been awarded.
        
       1. In the event that only one e-mail address is specified in the
           "entry notification form" for a "co-op" entry for which a
           contestant has been awarded a "co-op" "prize unit", said e-mail
           address shall be construed as said contestant's binding
           affirmation that said e-mail address is the one at which he/she
           can both send and receive e-mail missives to and from,
           respectively, valid Internet e-mail addresses.
       
       2. In the event that an e-mail address is not specified for each
           "team" member, but is specified for at least one "team" member,
           listed in the "entry notification form" for a "co-op" entry for
           which a "team" has been awarded a "co-op" "prize set", the lack
           of an e-mail address being specified for a particular contestant
           shall be construed as that contestant's binding affirmation that
           the first e-mail address listed in said "entry notification form"
           is the one at which he/she can both send and receive e-mail
           missives to and from, respectively, valid Internet e-mail
           addresses.
    
    P. Unless the "entry notification form" for an entry for which a
        contestant has been awarded a "solo" "prize set" or "co-op" "prize
        unit" contains a valid shipping address for said contestant(s) to
        which packages can be shipped COD from the state of California, said
        contestant(s) will forfeit said "solo" "prize set" or "co-op" "prize
        unit."  All components of a "solo" "prize set" and/or "co-op" "prize
        unit", except for those components which one or more of the sponsors
        is responsible for shipping to the competition's awardees, which
        contestant(s) has been awarded and which said contestant(s) has
        claimed, as per Sections I.N. and I.O., will be shipped COD to the
        shipping address specified in the "entry notification" for the entry
        for which said contestant(s) has been awarded said "solo" "prize
        set" or "co-op" "prize unit."
       
       1. In the event that only one shipping address is specified in the
           "entry notification form" for a "co-op" entry for which a
           contestant has been awarded a "co-op" "prize unit", said shipping
           address shall be construed as said contestant's binding
           affirmation that said shipping address is the one to which the
           components of the "co-op" "prize unit" that he/she has been
           awarded should be shipped COD.
       
       2. In the event that a shipping address is not specified for each
           "team" member, but is specified for at least one "team" member,
           listed in the "entry notification form" for a "co-op" entry for
           which a "team" has been awarded a "co-op" "prize set", the lack
           of a shipping address being specified for a particular contestant
           shall be construed as that contestant's binding affirmation that
           the first shipping address listed in said "entry notification
           form" is the one to which the components of the "co-op" "prize
           unit" that he/she has been awarded should be shipped COD.

       1. In the above chart, the numbers refer to the prizes listed in
           Sections III.A and indicate which prizes comprise a "solo" "prize
           set" or "co-op" "prize unit."
          
          a. For example, the "solo" "prize set" designated for 1st place in
              H2HMud01, "Fastest", at skill level 1 is one "Doom ToolKit",
              one registration for UltraLaunch 1.05, one copy of "Totally
              Unauthorized Guide to Doom II" and one copy of "Doom: Totally
              Unauthorized Tips or Secrets"
       
       2. In the "Co-Op" Section of the above chart, the number, "#", which
           follows the "x" in the expression "(x#)" indicates the number of
           "co-op" "prize units" that comprise the "co-op" "prize set".


IV. Entries may be submitted to only the following sites.
    
    A. The /pub/idgames/lmps/incoming directory of ftp.cdrom.com which is
    the site to which it is preferred that entries be submitted.
    
    B. H2H On Line BBS - BattleStation 1 ... (619) 426-0073, 8/N/1, 28800.
    
    C. STONEHENGE BBS - Home of the Mud wads (619) 929-6596, 8/N/1, 14400.
       
       1. Stonehenge BBS will have a different phone number on or about May
           15, 1995.


V.  The "Home of the DoomGods" part of the Competition.
    
    A. In addition to providing a way for contestants to win prizes, fame
        and glory for themselves, the competition also provides them a way
        to win fame and glory for their state/country.  Points will be
        earned for the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th place entries in each
        category.  The state/country which receives the most points will be
        awarded the title of "Home of the DoomGods."
       
       1. With the sole exception of the United State of America, any
           country may be designated in an entry's "Challenge."  Instead of
           the United States of America, an entry may designate one of the
           U.S.A.'s fifty states, one of it's territories or protectorates,
           e.g. Puerto Rico, or the District of Columbia.  (The U.S.A. is
           not allowed to be designated due to the overwhelming advantage
           that the U.S.A. would have over other countries in this
           competition.)  Any "Challenge" designation which fails to comply
           with this rule will be considered null and void.
       
       2. On the "entry form" there is a space reserved for "Challenge."  A
           contestant or "team" may indicate there what state/country state
           is to be awarded any points his/her or their "solo" or "co-op"
           entry, respectively, is awarded.  In the event that no
           "Challenge" is specified in said "entry form", none of the points
           earned by said entry will be awarded to any state/country.
          
          a. The only exception to this rule is applicable only to entries
              received prior to the official beginning of the competition.
              Contestants or "teams" who have submitted such entries may
              which state/country state is to be awarded any points his/her
              or their "solo" or "co-op" entry, respectively, by completing
              an "entry notification form" which is successfully e-mailed to
              mag8@aol.com along with a "carbon copy" to jelson@conline.com
              before the end of the competition.
       
       3. In the event that two or more countries and/or states have been
           awarded the same number of points, said country's and/or state's
           will be ranked according to their "points per entry average"
           which is determined by dividing a country's or state's total
           points by the number of entries that have earned it points.: a
           country or state with a higher "points per entry average" will be
           ranked higher than a country or state with a lower "points per
           entry average."
       
       2. In the event that two or more countries and/or states have earned
           the same number of points, and the same "points per entry
           average", said countries and/or states will be ranked according
           to their "time betterment average" which is determined by
           dividing the sum of a country's and/or state's "time betterments"
           by the number of the entries that have earned it points.: a
           country's and/or state's' with a higher "points per entry
           average" will be ranked higher than a country and/or state with a
           lower "points per entry average."  The "time betterment" for an
           entry is determined finding the difference between the "finish
           time" of said entry and the "finish time" of the entry in the
           same category with the next fastest "finish time."
    
    B. Any entry which wins 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th place in any of the
        "Prize Set" or "Home of the Doom Gods" categories will earn points
        for both the contestant(s) who submitted said entry and the
        country/state that is designated in said entry's "entry form."
    
    C. The twelve contestants which are earn the most points will each be
        awarded the title of "H2HMud DoomGod."  The contestant with the most
        points will also be awarded the title of "The DoomGod of the H2HMud
        DoomGods."
       
       1. In the event that two or more contestants have earned the same
           number of points, said contestants will be ranked according to
           their "points per entry average" which is determined by dividing
           a contestant's total points by the number of his/her entries that
           have earned him/her points.: a contestant with a higher "points
           per entry average" will be ranked higher than a contestant with a
           lower "points per entry average."
          
       2. In the event that two or more contestants have earned the same
           number of points, and the same "points per entry average", said
           contestants will be ranked according to their "time betterment
           average" which is determined by dividing the sum of a
           contestant's "time betterments" by the number of his/her entries
           that have earned him/her points.: a contestant with a higher
           "points per entry average" will be ranked higher than a
           contestant with a lower "points per entry average."  The "time
           betterment" for an entry is determined finding the difference
           between the "finish time" of said entry and the "finish time" of
           the entry in the same category with the next fastest "finish
           time."
    
    D. There are ten "Home of the DoomGods" categories.  These categories
        are distinguished from the "Prize Set" ones in that they are all
        "solo" categories and by the requirement that all valid entries in
        these categories must represent "100% or More Kills."
       
       1. As stated in Section I.C.2.c, the "% Kills" represented by an
           entry will be the percentage reported on the statistics screen
           that is displayed after the level has been exited by triggering
           the "exit switch."
       
       2. In order for an entry to be construed as representing "100% or
           More Kills", both of the following conditions must be met.
          
          a. The "% Kills" must be equal to or greater than 100.
          
          b. The entry's lmp must not contain any evidence that any monsters
              are left alive in the level at the moment that the "exit
              switch" is triggered.  The only exception to this rule is that
              it is not required that all or any of the "Lost Souls" on the
              level be killed so long as the condition stated in Section
              V.D.2.a. is met.
    
    E. Base points for the entries within a category are determined as
        follows.
       
       1. 1st place entry:  15 base points.
       2. 2nd place entry:  10 base points.
       3. 3rd place entry:   6 base points.
       4. 4th place entry:   3 base points.
       5. 5th place entry:   1 base point.
       6. All other entries: 0 base points.
    
    F. The number of a points a contestant earns for a particular entry in
        which he/she controlled a player is determined by multiplying the
        base points earned by one or more of three following modifiers when
        applicable.
       
       1. The "Skill Modifier" is determined by the skill level at each an
           entered lmp was played; it is 3, 2, and 1 for skill levels 4
           (Ultra Violence), 3 (Hurt Me Plenty), and 1 (I'm Too Young to
           Die), respectively.
       
       2. The "Kills Modifier" is applicable to entries in each of the ten
           "Fastest with 100% or More Kills" categories.  This modifier is
           2.
       
       3. The "Special Modifier" is applicable to entries in each of the two
           H2HMudDX "solo" categories.  This modifier is 2.
    
    G. The following chart illustrates the point totals for all the ranks
        and categories.  In this chart, the "F" and "FTK" columns represent
        the points earned in the "Fastest", i.e., "Prize Set" and "Fastest
        with 100% or More Kills", i.e., "Home of the DoomGods" categories,
        respectively, while "P" and "C/S" columns indicates the points
        earned by each of a "team's" members and the points earned by the
        country/state indicated in the "Challenge" section of said "team's"
        "entry form", respectively.
