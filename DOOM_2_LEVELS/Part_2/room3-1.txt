Description:            in the first room3 i put a boss shooter that showed
                        up in deathmatch - in this wad this feature has been
                        removed for better playability - other than that it
                        is the same as room3.wad
                        Awesome deathmatch level for 4 players.   
                        The 1st and 2nd levels of difficulity have
                        plasma rifles and a soul sphere in them - jus be sure
                        to get all the weapons before you jump off the
                        platforms - there are only the chaingun and double-shot
                        on the floor
