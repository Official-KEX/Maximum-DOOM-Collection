* Misc. Notes *

        This level is a revamped version of Carnage.wad.... it has been
converted to DOOM ][ format and is perfect for net deathmatch play.

        An obvious exit has been added to this wad.  It is in one of the
main rooms and you CAN'T MISS IT!  It has been added in order to allow
the players to exit when they are done and get a run-down of the frag counts.
This should eliminate liars and lamers.... I like to make sure there is NO
DOUBT that I rule when I play!

* Copyright / Permissions *

Authors MAY use this level as a base to build additional levels.  
Please email me if you do.... I like to see how psychotic other people
