Description             : This DOOM II deathmatch wad with a Stargate theme.  
                          It should be used with deathmatch 2.0
                          Includes a new sky texture (Non-repeating)
                          New Doors, and a Really cool animated Gate.
                          All weapons, one time chance at the BFG.
                          This is not a huge level the large file size comes 
                           from the new gfx's and music.     
                          All testing has gone great this level is a blast.
