Description             : After playing against some people who can
                          memorize a level after playing it 1 or 2 times
                          I decided and tried to create a board that would
                          be difficult to memorize, and it is.  Remember
                          the outside wall is a door where you can restock
                          your health and armor.  Enjoy!

Known Bugs              : In some places you will be able to 'see through'

                          know what is causing this or how to fix it.
                          The outside door sometimes does not make noise 
                          when opened, probably because it is so big.
