Title  : Joe's Deathmatch (Joe's.WAD)

This DOOM II level is kind of a rip-off of a Doom I level that I realy 
enjoyed playing. I say "kind of" because I haven't played the original 
for a few months and created this wad from scratch, based on my memory
of it. Anyway, it was designed as a deathmatch but has monsters and will 
play as a single player level as well, all wepons are there and it 
requires two players to exit (no fair jumping to the next level while 
your opponent has his BFG down). there are only slight changes through 
the difficulty levels, but they're there. Good luck finding the pumping 
station and watch out for trip wires!
