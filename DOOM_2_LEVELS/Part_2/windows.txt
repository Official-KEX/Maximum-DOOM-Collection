Description             : 
        Another octagon-shaped pwad for Doom2. Designed mainly 
        for deathmatch but playable in solo and cooperative modes
        Have tested in solo and deathmatch, works well in both
        modes and should work great in a four person network match!

Note!:  To get best deathmatch results, set diffilculty to ultraviolence.
        This turns on all weapons (including BFG in center of arena!)
