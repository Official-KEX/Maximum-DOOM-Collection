Description             : A nice little DeathMatch only WAD.  It requires
                          movement and minimizes luck.  There is a building 
                          in the middle of the wad which is similar to a 
                          local pizza place which is where the name comes 
                          from.

                          
                          Always beware of Venus--You never know what lies 
                          beyond her.

                          If your brave you can walk through lava falls.

                          Visit the Healing Pond when your down on Health.

                          Don't ever under estimate the power of armor.
