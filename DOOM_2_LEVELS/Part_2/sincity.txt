Description             : Five new Pwads for Doom II.These are the first five installments
                         of the Sin city series.The first episode has a fortress type
                         layout,there is only one secret room that is fairly easy to
                         find.This level shouldn't be too hard to complete even on Ultra
                         Violence.The second episode on the other hand,is not quite so
                         easy.Take your time,don't rush into any areas too quickly.Good luck on
                         Ultra Violence,even I have trouble with it.Episodes three thru
                         five are from the old Bloodfest Wad,which I created in May for
                         Doom.This is where the game gets rough.Episode three is a classic.
                         If you make it to the end you will be treated to an awsome visual
                         display.When you make it to the final room you will get some major
                         slowdown if you don't have a fast machine.If you can get 100% kills
                         on this level you cheated,but it is possible to finish.Episode four
                         is a nice little level,look hard for the red key before making your
                         way to the end or it's going to be rough.Episode five is the largest
                         Wad I have ever seen.Once your inside the fortress you can't leave so
                         get all the goodies outside you can before entering.I hope to have
                         more levels before long,meanwhile,Happy Dooming :)
