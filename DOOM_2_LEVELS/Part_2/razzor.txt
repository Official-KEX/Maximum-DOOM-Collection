Misc. Author Info       :

Description             : Razzor is a pure deathmatch level .The level is of
 a medium size and is very centralized so that theres a few different places
 to go but everyones going to end up back at the arena area.There are a few 
sniper areas that offer advantages but are also hazardous if your not 
careful ;-). All the weapons are present but if ya want the BFG ya gotta be
 pretty good with your controls. hehe
