showpal.exe playpal.d 4

showpal.exe playpa.h 255



These are the command lines to use to show palette 0 of the
playpal entry in the IWAD.

The number represents not only the color to show text in, but is useful to see
if you've located the right color.


Translate the grid into decimal i.e. 40x0A = (4*16)+10 = 74
