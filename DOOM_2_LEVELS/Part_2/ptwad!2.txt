The hottest wad in North Jersey goes National! All the weapons except chainsaw,
lots of ammo, sniper hiding places, wide open cross fire areas, secret doors,
powerups, and a hidden exit make this wad simply incredible. The author's first
spectacular wad, it promises the beginning of a bright future.

You are free to use and upload this wad anywhere in the world in its PRESENT,
UNCHANGED format, including THIS text file. Any other distribution is a   
violation of copyright laws, and is very anti-American. You may NOT include 
this wad in any software package, or as a stand alone product, in either a 
shareware or for-profit database, without the original author's authorized 
written permission. You may contact the author in the above manners.

Special thanks to b.t., Burn, Nightmare, MVM, and Ghost for playtesting, and
a really really special thanks to the writers of EdMap and Doom II for making
this wad possible. TELNET JUNGLE.NET. Ask for PowerTrip.

Enjoy the fraggin'!
