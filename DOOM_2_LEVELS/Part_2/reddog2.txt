Misc. Author Info       : avid doomer....spends WAY too much time deathmatching <g>

Description             : A set of 3 levels that I designed over the course of a 
                          month or so that are ideal for deathmatch play (especially
                          4 man deathmatch). There really is no theme cuz IMO wads
                          built with themes in mind suck when you actually play them...
