Title                   : Steel Cage Match   
Filename                : RING.WAD
Author                  : Robert Fleming

Misc. Author Info       : First working WAD

Description             : Steel Cage fight! Designed primarily
                          for DEATHMATCH in mind. New status bar    
                          designed by me, and new death sound.
                          For single or coop, watch as the crowd
                          follows you around the ring. Don't get
                          to close, they'll rip your head off.

Additional Credits to   : My old 286 which DEU2 was running on.
                          That was not a joke, DEU 5.21 runs on
                          a 286 (you must have the iwad file to
                          run it)
