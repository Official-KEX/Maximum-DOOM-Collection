                          Ladders. No, really. A level map with blinking
                          indicators. Mayhem. Destruction. Plot twists.
                          Air ducts. Vents. Secrets. Suspense.

Base                    : New level from scratch
Editor(s) used          : DEU 5.21 GCC, DCK 1.1b, DCK 2.1b, BSP 1.2x,
                          WACKER b7, DEUTEX 3.3, RMB 1.2.  This wad is over
                          500K for one level (whew) and underwent approximately
                          150 different revisions, about 30 of which were
                          lost when one of the tools crashed in mid-stream,
                          for whatever reason.  Probably not the tools'
                          fault. I did some really wierd stuff to fool the
                          DOOM engine.

Welcome to SHOOTS -N- LADDERS, the sequel to CARDIAC ARREST. One or two raves
poured in, so I figured I would top it. I think I did. I did some really strange
things to the DOOM engine, but I managed to pull it off. This level has
functional ladders throughout (not new, but at least well done). Also a tunnel
system and a HVAC system. The warehouse was designed specifically for
DEATHMATCH, and it is also fun to run around the other areas in hot pursuit
with a rocket launcher.

It is not a large level, but the additional sectors for the ladders make it
slow on < 486 computers. Also, if you have less than 4MB, I wouldn't
recommend saving (crashed when I tried this on my 386-40 4Mb).

Check out the map.  I think that this is -really- cool.

Pay for DOOM II.

Direct questions, comments, slander, etc. to lshelby@indy.net or
alt.games.doom.  I read the mail and a.g.d fairly regularly. If you like it,
please post.

The DOOM2 version is somewhat tougher than the DOOM version. However, there
are some VERY helpful secret rooms. Perhaps in the air vents. Check your
map.

Oh, by the way... Pay attention when you energize the gate.

Have fun.
