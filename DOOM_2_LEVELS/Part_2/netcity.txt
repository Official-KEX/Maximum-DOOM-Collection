- Perfect for deathmatch 
- A bit heavy for a 486 (but still entertaining)
- If you have 'problems' with level 4 ... try level 2 :-)
- No secrets

- To exit, in deathmatch mode, you have to push a button 
  to let someone else going out quickly. It avoid individual
  initiative about ending the level.
  This button is not usefull in single player mode.

Enjoy ...
