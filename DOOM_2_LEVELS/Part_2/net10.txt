Description             : This one is the 10th in a continuing series of maps 
                          that are perfect for net play.  This one has a LOT to
                          offer in the way of secret areas, LOTS of guns/ammo 
                          (Every gun is in the level at least twice), and WIDE 
                          open areas for shooting each other.  This map may 
                          appear to be sort of small, but that's because I 
                          opened it up (After trying it w/ all the doors, it
                          was boring because there was no way to sneak up on 
                          anyone.)  

Additional Credits to   : Taleisin Journe for helping me test and for being a 
                          great target  :).  And King Rich (a.k.a. Nazi Eskimo) 
                          for being Taleisin's great target.
