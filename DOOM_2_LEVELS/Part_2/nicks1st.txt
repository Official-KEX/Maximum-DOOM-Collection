Description             : This is my first attempt at WAD creation, but I think
			  it's pretty good. I tried to capture that spooky, nerve-
			  wracking feel; lots of darkness and monsters.

Additional Credits to   : Everyone involved in the creation of DOOM2 and
			  Deep 6.13b. Mommy.

Additional Notes        : Please send me any (constructive) comments 
			  or suggestions for improvement.
