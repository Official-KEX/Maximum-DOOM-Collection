    8( - Some how the automap is disfunctional 8).  Really, it doesn't 
        matter.  This wad is constructed in a such a way you cannot
        get lost.  Wad editors will have to suffice for previews this time.
        Somehow I have pushed the doom engine to hard - Use your map editor.
        
    8) - The following is a list of what candy is in the PWAD:
        1 BFG                           2 boxes of shells
        1 Plasma Rifle                  2 boxes of bullets
        1 Chain Gun                     3 shotgun shells (4 to a pack)
        1 Rocket launcher               3 boxes of rockets
        1 Double barrel                 3 energy cells - 20
        1 Single barrel                 2 energy cells - 100
        1 Chain saw
        Everybody gets one pistol 8)
                                           
       30 Health bonus +1               1 Supercharge (blue sphere)
        1 Beserk strength               1 megasphere (gold)
        2 medikits 25%                  2 Invisibility spheres
        1 Backpack                      1 Invulnerability sphere
        1 Light amp goggles
        1 Green Armor
        1 Blue Armor
     8)   - Secret Stuff. hmmm. Like I siad LOOK. I have read most design FAQs.
          - Hint. There are 8 teleporters. Specifically, there are 8
          which WILL teleport you! Enough hints. PLAY NOW! (imagine some
          weird star trek voice).


If you play this WAD in a 2,3, or 4 person deathmatch, record and LMP and send it to
me!  I'd love to see how others do in this level!  Also, please send any 
comments/suggestions/gripes/praises that you have.  Happy hunting!
