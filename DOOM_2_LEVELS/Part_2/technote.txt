This file contains some technical information on DFE.

If you are using EMM386 and wish to use the Sound Blaster WAD sound player,
you will want to add D=64 to the command line of EMM386.EXE in your
config.sys file.  This will prevent EMM386 from crashing on you when you
attempt to play a sound that is greater than 32k in length.  Note for SCSI
users: you may already have the D= parameter set for EMM386, as long as
this number is 64 or greater, it does not need to be changed.

If you have a copy of DFE 3.00 and you are using a Novell Network, STOP!!!
Use 3.10 instead.  I was not thinking when I wrote the loader program for
DFE 3.00.  Its loader uses what is probably the most crutial interrupt in
Novells API for itself.  3.10 corrects this problem.

There is still one known conflict with DFE:  It is not compatible with
DoubleDos  (Not DoubleSpace!).  DoubleDos is a multitasking addition to DOS
similiar to DesqView.

MS Windoze users:  DFE is not designed to be executed under windows!  It will
for the most part work corretly, but certian features, such as IPXFER and
the Sound Player, are very much DOS oriented.  I have receive comments that
IPXFER will cause problems with Windows 3.11 for Work Groups and will some
times cause problems with other LAN (Novell, etc) operations under windows.

For most functions of DFE, a mouse is required, This includes the Map viewing
options.  The ExeHacker does not require a mouse, but it is HIGHLY recoomended
that you use one.
