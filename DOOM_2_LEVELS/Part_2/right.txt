Misc. Author Info       : Deathmatch virgin (running 2400 baud 'til
			  my birthday)

Description             : My first Doom ][ wad.  Play it.  Love
                          it.  Hate it.  Go play other wads.

Wad Fun Fact            : Called "right.wad" because my first 15
                          tries at wad-building resulted in Node
			  building problems.  As in "Yeah, RIGHT, 
			  like THIS time it's going to work."
