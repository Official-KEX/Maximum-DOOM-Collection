================================================================
Description             : A large alien base has been discovered by 
			  a Scout and Survey team in the Regulus
			  Cluster on a close Terran analogue.
			  Sensor readings show possible traces of
			  a highly advanced technology. You've been 
			  assigned the job of exploration. Relax! 
			  Fleet Intel reports that it's 99.999%
			  likely that the base is unoccupied and
			  probably friendly (yeah,right!). You won't
			  be allowed to carry any weapons in but your
			  pistol... as usual. 

			  FI also reports that sensors show five 
			  areas adjoining the main plaza, and
			  suggests exploration counter-clockwise from
			  the southeast. Some security gates and
			  devices do seem to still show energy flows... 
			  strange. You will beamed into one location 
			  showing some anomalous energy readings.

			  By The Way - you wouldn't want to upgrade your
			  insurance plan now - would you?

INSTRUCTIONS              Oracle.wad is ~~1.3 MEG. If you sucessfully
			  extracted/unzipped it, from the \DOOM2 directory,
			  you should be able to type the following :

			  DOOM2 -FILE ORACLE.WAD  [-options] <ENTER>

Play notes:               You will require Doom ][ and a 486/66 with
			  local video to be able play this wad well.
			  This wad is the largest single level we 
			  know of, and some impact on play speed is
			  impossible to avoid. However we have used all
			  means at our disposal, especially RMB, to make
			  it playable, and we beleive it is.

			  Co-op and Deathmatch notes:
			  This wad is large and complex, hence not 
			  ideally suited for multi-player play and
			  potentially slow. But, the starts are
			  there and it HAS been tested and support
			  HAS been added.
