* Play Information *

Game                    : DOOM II
Level #                 : MAP1
Single Player           : Yes, just take a look, kill some monsters... 
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : What's the point?
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : YES!  Kill yer buddies...very cozy 2 or 3 player and
                          hectic 4 player.  This is an earlier wad I designed
                          and redesigned repeatedly, learning how to do wad
                          editing.  I've done just about everything I can to
                          it and there should be no more revisions.  There is    
                          an exit behind the candles for totalling scores. 
                          There are several secrets in this wad, which will
                          augment play for those who discover them.  Enjoy!
