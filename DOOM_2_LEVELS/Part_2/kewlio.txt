Description             : This is the sequel to kewl, if you liked it, you
                          will love kewlio, if you hated kewl, because of
                          dead ends and no ammo, those are no longer problems.
                          With no dead-ends, and lots of ammo, comes kewlio.
                          This is a deathmatch wad.
