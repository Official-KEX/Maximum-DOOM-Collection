                    ****The S&J wad collection V1.2****

*****************************************************************************
This wad collection was made by two Oregon State University doom 2 fanaticks.
It is not an attempt to show off wad making mastery, for we are just beginners
and these are our first creations.  We were just trying to make good 
deathmatch levels with the intent being fun.

  We thank the maker of waded, our creation program, and the maker of pimp.wad 
for some ideas we borrowed.

  Level descriptions:

  Map 1:  This is done by the S in our S&J team, his modified and entertaining 
  version of the first level.  This was his first experiment with Doom level 
  making, so take it easy on him if you don't like it.  We feel this is the 
  best size doom level for deathmatch fun, for it features frequent encounters
  that some of the doom2 later levels dont offer.  this theme is in our wads.
  
  Map 2:  The first original done by S in the S&J team, it features a plasma 
  soulsphere combo that he loves so much.  Notice that same combo in map one.
  this level focuses on a simple but balanced lay out.  The level is just  
  plain interesting enough to be played without getting bored.
  
  Map 3: The J in S&J's team did this one. There isnt too much to say.  
  It features rooms that have loops or double exits out of.  Just a quick 
  level to play on deathmatch a couple of times.
  
  Map 4:  J again, this one features a loop around a main center area.  Lots 
  of weapons, dont use rockets on the chase, they dont get the job done.
  
  Map 5:  This one is also the J.  Ever get sick of rematerializing, blasted,
  (*repeat*) many times.  well this one ALMOST gets rid of that dillema.

  We dont remember that sheet of features so:
  Doom2 levels 1-5, new designs, and nothing much else.  We are currently 
  working on sounds, music, and graphics, so we can eventually create a dorm wad
  complete with actual dorm graphics.  
  Maps 1 and 2: single, co-oper, dmatch
  Maps 3,4, and 5: dmatch only, and timed if you want to see other levels. 
  (no exits)

  we almost forgot to thank those wonderful doom2 creator people at id software 
  for such a lasting game.
