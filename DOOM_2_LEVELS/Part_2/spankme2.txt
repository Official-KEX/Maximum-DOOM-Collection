Misc. Author Info               : Spends far too much time playing Doom 
			  
Description                     : This is an update of spankme to run with DooM II, I've changed the wall textures and moved some of the weapons about. This level is designed for DEATHMATCH. There is no real theme to theis level and its fairly simple, just a whole heap of good clean fraggin' fun. 

Additional Credits to           : Adam Gilchrist and Andy Banks for playtesting. ID software, you make it worthwhile buying a PC.

Additional Notes                : There are monsters in this level if you want to do single player. But then you must be sad and lonely with no freinds to frag.
