Description             : This is a completely blueprint accurate WAD of my 
                          house. I designed the level so my friends who don't
                          have doom can come over to play Doom via modem would 
                          know the level without having to ask me which way to 
                          turn all the time. I also added a few underground
                          tunnels and secret passageways that my house 
                          obviously doesn't have. There are hidden teleporters, 
                          detailed furniture, and a couple great hiding places. 
                          Even though the size of the file is large, the level
                          itself is not that big.  It is because of the 
                          furniture.  Be sure to check out the fireplace and
                          Bathroom's with moving toxic waste!!!
                          This is my first attempt at creating a WAD so please
                          be kind. 
                               Enjoy!!! (please tell my what you think!!!)

                          and my friends for play testing the thing to death!

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch, based on blueprints of 
                          my house.
Build Time              : At least twenty hours, 
                          (plus unmeasurable testing time!) 
Editor(s) used          : DoomCAD 4.3 and BSP 1.2
Known Bugs              : NO known bugs, but when you go upstairs instead of 
                          being able to walk all the way up you are instantly 
                          teleported to the upstairs level. I had to do this 
                          because DOOM is not really 3-D. It still has to have 
                          a 2-D map so levels cannot be piled on top of each 
                          other. Just remember, there is more than one way 
                          into almost every room!
