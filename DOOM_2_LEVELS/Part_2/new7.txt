New7 is my second published WAD, so go easy on me, but not as easy as you
did for my first  :).  New7, as the name implies, is a shameless ripoff of
Doom 2's level 07, which seems to be a favorite deathmatch level.

Description             : If you've ever played DOOM 2, you'll remember
                          level 7, with the mancubi and the spiderdemons.
                          I modified this level, because I've played too
                          many ALTDEATHS where one person gets the weapons,
                          and the other can't get anything until they are
                          killed and reappear outside the court area
                          (Near the BFG).  This remake has the area opened
                          up from the beginning, plus I added 2 teleports,
                          moved a few things around, and changed some of
                          the mechanics.  I also removed the BFG, which
                          while it is a favorite toy of mine, tends to
                          ellicit cries of "waaaaah!" from certain other
                          players.  The 4 buttons on the walls now lower
                          sections of wall between the courtyard and the
                          outer hallway, plus 2 other small suprises.
                          I added a crushing ceiling (which may be
                          hard to find) and other nifty little items.
                          No incredible secrets, however, so just play it.
                          
                          One small note:  The 4 platforms with the weapons
                          now lower like normal lifts, i.e. by pressing
                          on the sides of them.  They will rise back up.
                          This'll slow some people down a bit, but there
                          are ALWAYS ways around these things in NEW7.

                          play (right.  sacrificed), everyone in my
                          Networking class who played, and everyone

                          creating a wonderful game from which I have
                          shamelessly stolen.
