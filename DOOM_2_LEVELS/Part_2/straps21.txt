*** STRAPS v2.1 ***

A DOOM ][ level, designed for (and by!) a single player...

This was originally a Doom I level, a long, long time ago, while
I was learning DEU. It has grown and changed since...

It is the only "real" WAD I have made so far... Yes, it is my
first try; I know that it is hard to believe after playing it! :)

In my humble opinion, this level is well-designed and fun to play.
I love playing it on Ultra-Violence, although it is probably much
too hard... :) Have fun!

Title                   : STRAPS v2.1 (Doom ][ version)
                          (Straps probably means Soulman's Traps or
                           something... :)
Filename                : STRAPS21.WAD, STRAPS21.ZIP
Author                  : Knut Arild Erstad (the Soulman)
Email Address           : ip103@ii.uib.no (until summer -95)
Misc. Author Info       : Student, MOD-composer, Doom-addict...

Description             : Dark. Lots of traps... Watch your back!
                          And remember:
                          "The fact that you are paranoid, doesn't
                           mean that they are NOT out to get you."

Additional Credits to   : Qaz (is that your real name? :) for testing
                          this level... And I suppose I'll have to
                          thank ID. (deja-vu...) And the authors of
                          Deu, Deu2 and BSP. And <this place is for
