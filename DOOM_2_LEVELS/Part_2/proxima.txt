Description             : This WAD file supports all three modes of play:
                          Deathmatch, Single, and Co-Op.  Its an 
                          indoor/outdoor setting with some excellent DM
                          battle areas.  The cyberdemon can end up helping
                          you out quite a bit if you know how to manipulate
                          him. ;)
