Title                   : Khorne's Demise   
Filename                : khorne.WAD
Author                  : Bill Turner III
E-mail address          : AOL user name GUNDOX
Description             : The first installment in a series of levels I plan
			  to create. The central theme is the destruction
			  of the Blood God, Khorne (as found in the RPG
			  Warhammer by Games Workshop.)
			  This wad is excellent for deathmatch. It has only
			  been tested for 2 player via null modem but should
			  work fine with networks and phone-modem.
			  Single play of the game is quite enjoyable.
			  Consecutive levels of the game will be released
			  individually as well as grouped with earlier levels.
			  Oh, this is only my second wad but I believe it
			  to be better than most of the wads I've D/L'd. I
			  pay attention to detail. 

			  I'm including DeHackEd v2.2 with the wad.
			  Unzip it and read directions to use KHORNE.DEH
			  with KHORNE.WAD. You need it to get the right
			  feel into the level.

			  If you find bugs please E-Mail me.

			  Thanks and Enjoy!
