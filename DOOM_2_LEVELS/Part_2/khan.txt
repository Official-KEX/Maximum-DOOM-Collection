     DM_KHAN2 adds a few things dm_khan1 was missing. Namely an exit, and  
non-deathmatch starts for viewing offline.
     DM_KHAN2 is a "for deathmatch only" wad. There was no support
added for coop play (i.e. no monsters). I tried to incorporate some 
new ideas/features without ruining the fun of simplicity. I appreciate 
any comments, complaints, or suggestions you might have for future wads.

P.S. - I don't know if there's any legalese that needs to be in here so...

Blah blah blah, yadda yadda yadda ID Software.
