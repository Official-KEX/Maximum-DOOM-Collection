Description             : This is a medium sized level that is
                          very good for 2 players. It isn't a
                          big level even though the wad size is
                          big. It is sort of fast-paced for a 
                          good amount of frags. There is no BFG.
                          I don't think it's fun in deathmatch.
                          This should be a fun level for anyone.
