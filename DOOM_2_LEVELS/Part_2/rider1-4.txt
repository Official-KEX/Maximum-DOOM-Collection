Description             : This is a combo of all levels that I have
                          released under the Rider label. Also contains
                          my fav mix of deathmatch sounds, starring my
                          no.1 idol, Homer! I hope you find it as
                          enjoyable as i have.

Misc Game Info          : Read my other TXT files for a run-down of each
                          level.
                          
                          I STRONGLY recommend playing these levels
                          through a front-end like APCI DOOM. None of my
                          levels have exits, so you'll need a timer to
                          be fair. Plus, I've found APCI to be much
                          faster with a 2 player connection than SERSETUP,
                          and it wont hang up when you quit.
