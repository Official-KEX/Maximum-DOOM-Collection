Description             : Once again, a pretty small level. Set in a tall
                          house of some-sort with brick inner walls. I've 
                          placed a lot of look-outs around the perfectly
                          simetric room, and it pays to have a fast system
                          to be able to guide your way around without bumping
                          into walls :).
                         
Misc Game Info          : Here's the tip: If you know your enemy is waiting
                          for you to come back out through a teleporter, 
                          simply walk backwards while on the platform (looking
                          down the lane of slime), this will place you up on
                          the center platform, and hope behind the dude your
                          about to toast!
