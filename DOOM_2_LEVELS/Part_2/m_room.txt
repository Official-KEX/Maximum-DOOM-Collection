Misc. Author Info       :  He hates authoring wads (read: lazy)
Description             : This is not an original level! I modified someone else's! I take abolutely no credit in the
                         design of this wad. The original was unique and fun as hell, but I grew tired of the same
                         old weapons and look, so I "made" this.
Additional Credits to   :  The original wad, j_room4.wad, was created by Jordan Russel.
