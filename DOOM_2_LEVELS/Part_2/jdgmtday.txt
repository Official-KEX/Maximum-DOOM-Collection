Description             : The Ultimate Deathmatch WAD, Judgment Day brings some new
			  and very interesting concepts into the world of Deathmatch.
			  Set in a futuristic arena with one goal in mind... To determine
			  the Ultimate DOOM Warrior!

Additional Credits to   : All the great people at id Software for creating
			  the greatest PC/Video game EVER, and Ben Morris for his
			  "most excellent" Doom Construction Kit.

Other WADS		: HELLHOLE.WAD for DOOM. More an exercise in WAD construction
			  Than a really "playable" level, but very interesting to look at.

Misc Author info.	: I'm a 35 year old father of two living in Providence, RI
			  with a mortgage and two car payments. How I ever find time to do
			  all this DOOM stuff is beyond me. I'm also a BIG fan of X-Wing/
			  TIE Fighter and Transport Tycoon.
