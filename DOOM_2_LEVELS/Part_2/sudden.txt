Misc. Author Info       : a C programmer in the San Antonio area...
                          always looking for deathmatch opponents...

Description             : Fast-paced single level deathmatch.  Contains very
                          interesting map features and secrets.  I have
                          included an exit even though it is only one level.
                          When playing with monsters, expect to have a very
                          hard time living through your exit attempt.  Try
                          to sucker one of your opponents into exiting!!!
                          And HIDE when all HELL breaks loose!!!

                          Hint: Every kind of weapon is on this level, and
                          all of them must be found by at least one player
                          before anyone can exit.  This INCLUDES Berserker!

                          Also supports single/co-op play, if desired.

                          Don't forget to turn out the lights before you
                          leave...    :)

                          This seems to be a common problem with moving
                          ceilings in multi-player games.  Please send I-net
                          mail to the address above if you find any other
