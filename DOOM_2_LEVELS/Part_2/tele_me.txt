Email Address           : rpollard@iquest.net
Misc. Author Info       : I'm too old to be playing DOOM.
			  That's why I play DOOM ][!  ;-P
Description             : My first DeathMatch-Only WAD.  I
			  just jumped into DCK v 2.2 and started
			  building it.  There are several tele-
			  porters in this level, but only 3 main
			  rooms.  It's not hard to learn where
			  you are going and the fastest way to
			  get there.  (Meaning your buddy is
			  dead meat quick!)
Additional Credits to   : id, for making DOOM, DOOM ][ and Heretic
			  and to Ben Morris for the incredible
			  editor, DCK (DOOM Construction Kit).
			  Also, thanks to my Beta Testers, Dave
			  Clark and Marc Howell.
