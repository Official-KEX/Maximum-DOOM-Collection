Author                  : Swipe (If you need to know my real name, ask a sysop
                          or mod on DWANGO) And some great help from S-bug.

Misc. Author Info       : See you on Dallas DWANGO
Description             : 4 really good levels for doom ][.  One looks simple
                          but is great for dmatch, the other is kinda weird..
                          the second is better with 4 players, the first 
                          supports any amount, except 1.  There is a hidden  
                          Invincibility And maybe a Megasphere. I think I 
                          forgot.  (yeah right)

* Copyright / Permissions *
Do whatever the hell you want with the first level, but get 
permission from s-bug (on dwango) before you screw around with 
the second.  Any improvements would be appreciated (i'm gonna have
my hands full after that) and inform me, bug me, slap me over the
head with a chicken leg, etc. if you have any improvements.  also
some new music, graphics, sound, etc. would be nice.  and anyone
with a really good level can tell me and I'll add it.

You MAY distribute this WAD, provided you include this file, with
no modifications.  You may distribute this file in any electronic
format (BBS, Diskette, CD, etc) as long as you include this file 
intact.  Yada yada yada.. just don't change the txt file if you don't
change the wad.

This part of the text file you may change if you find it elsewhere.
