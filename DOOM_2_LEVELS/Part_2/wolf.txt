Misc. Author Info       : Sometimes, I really don't know about me.....

Description             : This is the first 4 levels of Doom 2, now with only
                          one enemy (the Wolfenstein soldiers) and 2 weapons
                          (the super shotgun and the chaingun) !!  Ammo is
                          scare and so is the health, so when you find some,
                          you better conserve it a little !
