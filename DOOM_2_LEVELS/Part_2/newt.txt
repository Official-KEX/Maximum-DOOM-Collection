Other Files By Author   : Oh, a couple goofy .wads here and there...
Misc. Author Info       : I'm a keyboarder, and not the best player in the
                          world, but what the hell. I've included an .lmp of
                          myself winning the level. It's not a perfect game,
                          but I do come out of it alive.
Description             : It's a 'constant-wave, oh-look-another-room-full-
                          of-monsters' kind of level, but what the hell.
                          It's also about the best original level I've
                          made so far, so bite me.
Additional Credits to   : I hate to say this (Sorry, Jeff Rabenhorst!) 
                          Ben Morris of DCK 2.2 fame... ID... And the guy 
                          who made the JAX levels (Ya kinda gave me the
                          idea, ya see...)
