Description             : My second released DOOM ][ Level...
			  
			  On the planet Pascala on top of  
			  Mt. Integer, off the second coast of
			  Firspro, dwells an awesome power known 
			  as...        R U R Q T A ! ! !
			  Known to take the form of a CyberDemon,
			  Rurqta rules the land under his iron hoof,
			  and presides on top of a huge tower guarded
			  by many of his finest soliders. Only the
			  most experienced fighters have been known to
			  even make it to the halfway point before being
			  destroyed in an udderly painful way. 
			  
			  You have been dumped on the mountain by the
			  Legion of Bastards for their initiation
			  ceremony. Survive, and you're inducted.
			  Die, and you'll be...dead. (WOW!)
							
			  <RURQTA can only been seen on Ultra-Violence
				     or Nightmare mode.>
			  

Additional Notes        : Tell me what you think...This is my second P-Wad
			  worthy (or, at least i hope so) to be released.
			  Please send any comments or suggestions for 
			  improvements or modifications. There are a 
			  couple of walls that appear as normal, but
			  really aren't solid. LOOK FOR THESE. Also,
			  This level has been playtested for Detahmatch,
			  many a time...IT REIGNS SUPREME....i think.
