Description             : Welcome to Castle Tazmania.  This is a DOOM ][ Level
						  designed primarily for deathmatch play.  I took great
						  care to choose textures appropriately for all rooms,
						  and I also spent a lot of time aligning the textures
						  to make the secrets a little harder to find.  (I cannot
						  abide those who throw something together in an hour
						  without even trying to align textures, and then expect
						  us to play it).  I am especially proud of the walls in
						  the spiral staircase.  A lesser man would have left the
						  venetian-blind effect there because it was so much
						  trouble to correct.  I always enjoy watching perfectly
						  matched walls go by as I'm running full speed, guns
						  a-blazin'.

Additional Credits to   : The authors of DOOM II, EdMap, and DoomCad 5.0
						  And my deathmatch partners, The Prince of Darkness,
						  Gabby, Mav, and JT.  (It was Gabby's idea for the
						  "split" door into the control room (and a few other
						  things.)).

* Additional Information *

Here's where I SHOULD give away the secrets, but I won't.  There are SO MANY,
I can't even remember them all, anyway.  Believe me, you'll never find them all.
There are no hidden switches, though.  All regular doors and lifts should be
pretty obvious to the seasoned DOOM player.  So you shouldn't have to wander 
around hitting the spacebar on every wall (I hate that).  There are, however,
so many one-sided walls (walls you can walk through and shoot through that
look real) that I can't even count them in my head.  (Every good castle has 
a network of secret hallways!)  ALL rooms have at least two ways in and two
ways out (though most of them have three or more), so there shouldn't be any
way for someone to hole-up and snipe everyone.

This is your basic castle layout, with a courtyard, dining hall, library,
dungeon, moat, and yes, even a bedroom (check out those pillows!).  The
castle maze serves no real purpose, but it does have a great ambush room in
it, with indicators for ambushers to know when an ambushee is approaching.
This castle has been upgraded with the latest in castle security systems,
so it has a master control room.  I put an exit in the control room because
we all like to get those frag stats.

Okay, okay, okay, I'll help you out a little with one of the harder secrets.
In the dungeon, there is a BFG 9000 on a pedestal that won't come down.
Remember in "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" when he had three secrets
to pass to reach the Holy Grail?  The last one was "The Leap of Faith from
the Lion's Mouth".  "But how do I get up to the lion's mouth?", you ask?
I'm not going to answer that one.  Just remember, there are no hidden
switches, and all doors and lifts should be obvious to seasoned DOOMers.

If you are REALLY a glutton for cheating, drop me a note, and I'll tell you
about all the secrets I can remember.
