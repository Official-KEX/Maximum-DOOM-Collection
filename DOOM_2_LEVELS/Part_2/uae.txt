Description             : DOOM II "Elite" version of the DOOM Urban Assault
                          PWAD. Modified (and glorified) for DOOM II freaks!
                          Level is based on a generic city w/ several
                          generic structures. It's specifically made for
                          multi-player deathmatch, but it does have a few
                          monsters for single-play.
                          This is, by far, my *best* level ever created.

Known Bugs              : Two. There are two known structural problems dealing

                          at fixing this problem, but DEU2 decided to give me
                          continual memory problem errors.
