================================================================

This level was created with deathmatch firmly in mind.  Sniper spots and
places to run across your opponent(s) are plentiful, and yet, there's
plenty of areas to get lost in for awhile.

All weapons except the BFG are present, though not all are easily
attainable.  Ammo for each weapon is available, but you'll often wish
there was more.  All testing was done with the -altdeath switch present.

I personally prefer monsters in my deathmatch, so Revile has plenty of
those.  If you don't like 'em, use the -nomonsters switch.  I don't
recommend the use of the -respawn switch however, or you'll be sorry...

Secrets are all very well hidden, but there's always something there to
give them away.  Check the map for possible clues.  There is an exit,
but it's meant to be found only after hours of play. :-)

Additional Credits to   : Eric Schreiber for helping to play-test this
                          monstrosity.  Heck, though it was like pulling
                          teeth, he may have even made a few useful
                          suggestions for improvement as well...
