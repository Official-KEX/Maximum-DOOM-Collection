Description             : A weird Doom 2 DM level that's designed for surprise
                          and shock value.  This level, for anyone who is an
                          inexperienced DM player, is evil.  It's complex,
                          dark, dangerous, and intense.  Cool architecture,
                          too.

Additional Credits to   : Jesse Gilles and Jason Statz, for testing.

Additional Notes        : This level is hard on the computer, even without 
                          enemies, and I recommend at least a 486/25.  I 
                          haven't played it with more than two players, but it 
                          should be plenty big for four.  I decided at the last 
                          minute to replace level two with a puny but 
                          entertaining level I designed a while ago.  
                          Individually, this level filled only 6k, so I figured 
                          it might be worth it.  Level 2 may be small, but it's 
                          great fun if you play it in the right frame of mind.  
                          I don't recommend more than 2 players, though, as 
                          there's probably end up being about a frag every 15 
                          seconds.
                               Other publicly availiable levels I've done are
                          Zygote, The Reservoir, Maze, and (The best DM wad
                          I've personally played) Maze-X.(Zygote.ZIP,
                          Resrvoir.ZIP, Maze.ZIP, and Mazex.ZIP).

      --=What's this fanzine thing I've heard so much about?=--

        A fanzine is kind of like a newsletter, except extremely informal.
Generally pretty chaotic and entertaining, too.  Mine is Matrix, and it
focuses mostly and video & computer games.  There's also some stuff on MRPGs,
movies, and such.  To get a copy cheap ($1.00, which only covers printing
and shipping costs), write to:
