Description             : I've seen this film at the theatre three
                          times and I couldnt let it go without it's
                          own PWAD.  :) I've replaced quite a few of
                          the sounds including the addition of the
                          first 10 seconds of `Miserlou' (the song
                          in the trailer).  I got all these samples
                          from the soundtrack so when it comes out on
                          video I'll probably make a brand new one
                          with much more to it. :)  But this still
                          replaces the majority of sounds including
                          the pistol which i replaced with Jules'
                          pistol sound (_much_ cooler sounding than
                          original).  So give it a try and if you havent
                          already, GO SEE THE MOVIE!  It's my personal
                          favorite movie of all time. (BTW:  Due to lack
                          of available sounds, this only replaces sounds
                          from Doom 1, but will still _work_ in Doom 2.  It
                          just won't replace doom 2's new sounds, that's all)
                          And if anybody happens to have some more sounds
                          (I dont care how you get em, no questions asked :)
                          feel free to send em to me and I'll include em
                          in the `finished' version.  Thanks!

Additional Credits to   : Quentin Tarantino for creating the truly
                          great film these fx came from. :)
