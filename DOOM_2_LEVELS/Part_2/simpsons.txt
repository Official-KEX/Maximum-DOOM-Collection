* Additional Description *

Every character has been replaced with a simpsons character, including
you as Homer.  Additional sprites have been changed as well, although
all the weapons remain the same along with most other flashy but useless
sprites.  Sound for these characters have been replaced as well to
coordinate with the pictures.  I must give some credit to the original
creator of HOMER.WAD for the idea and a few sounds.

        You -----------------------> Homer
        Rifle Soldiers ------------> Moe, the bartender
        Shotgun Soldiers ----------> Police Chief Wiggam
        Imps ----------------------> Abu, the Kwik-E-Mart clerk
        Demons --------------------> Barney
        Barons --------------------> Flanders
        Skulls --------------------> Krusty the Clown
        Cacodemons ----------------> Side-show Bob
        Spider Demon --------------> Smithers
        Cyber Demon ---------------> Mr. Burns

Also, I included a batch file to automate running doom (along with your
favorite arguments).  One snag, though.  The dead body pictures is the
same as the last frame of Homer's death.  So rather than having lots
of dead homer's lying around, I changed the frame table to make the
last frame of player's death to 132 (on Doom 1.2) rather than 133.  And
then I just kept the green guy dead picture for those dead bodies.
Without this hack (using Dehacked), the player death will initially
start as Homer, and he will turn into the green guy for the final dead
body (not the end of the world).

Have some fun, and kick some Simpsons ass!
