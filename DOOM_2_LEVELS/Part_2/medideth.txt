================================================================
* Description *

This level is the successor to MINIDETH.WAD (Miniature Death-
Match) and shares a similar theme. Those of you who have played 
MINIDETH may recognize a few things in MEDIDETH. It has been 
designed with more than two players in mind, though it works 
well with just two. It is roughly four times larger than its 
predecessor but still not very large and high frag counts can be 
achieved in a short period of time. 

The level is based around a large central room that is broken up 
by stacks of various sized crates that can be climbed and used 
to block incoming gun fire. There are many nooks and crannies to 
ambush from as well as a few easily defended sniper ledges that 
offer a good view of much of the level. There are numerous 
teleporters (located inside of certain crates) that give access 
to the more powerful weapons and a lift that leads to one of the
sniper ledges, all of which are marked by small white arrows 
upon the floor. 

The plasma rifle is easy to get to but getting away with it is 
another matter; one misstep and you'll find yourself in an 
inescapable Archvile trap, much to the enjoyment of the other 
players, who can watch you getting tossed around like a ragdoll 
from the safety of the main room. This trap will only trigger in 
Multi-Player mode. Getting to the BFG requires the use of a 
hidden teleporter, a couple of jumps, and a stationary 180 
degree turn (not necessarily in that order). 

The level has a few monsters (besides the archviles in the trap) 
that have been thrown in to keep everyone on their toes. You can 
choose which ones you'd like to have in the level by choosing 
the approprate skill setting:

Skills 1 & 2 - A few roaming baby spiders, 
               Chaingunners at the sniping 
               windows, and the Archies in 
               the trap.

Skill 3      - Only the Archies in the trap.

Skills 4 & 5 - A roaming Archvile (heheh...
               watch your buddies literally 
               fly over the crates!) and
               the Archies in the trap.

Obviously, in order to take full advantage of the Archvile
trap, you need to play without the -NOMONSTERS parameter.
When playing with 3 or 4 players, use -DEATHMATCH instead of
-ALTDEATH; this will ensure that everyone has immediate
access to a weapon. If you play the level with roaming
monsters, you may want to add the -RESPAWN parameter so that
the monsters will keep coming back.

This level also works with the original DOOM. When played in
DOOM, all of the DOOM II monsters and power-ups are replaced 
with original DOOM monsters and power-ups; the Archvile trap 
becomes a Baron trap. The level has the same new music for 
Both DOOM and DOOM II. Making this level compatible with both 
games meant a larger file size, but it's not overly large and 
should only take a minute or two to download.

I'd like to thank all of the regular DOOMers at CRIS, who have 
done lots of Multi-Player playtesting in both this level and 
it's predecessor. Sje deserves special mention for being the 
first to entertain us by getting caught in the Archvile trap. 
Heheh... I looked up and saw the bottom of your feet, Sje!
Thanks also to Mike Stevens (I TOLD you that you couldn't 
get any frags on me using that steering wheel, FOOL!) for the
idea of raising the player's height in front of the sniper's 
windows to allow better clearance for rockets (the result of 
which is those small stone bricks at each window). Finally,
I'd like to thank Jazz411@aol.com, whose VERYTINY.WAD gave me
the idea for MINIDETH (baby brother to MEDIDETH).

I'd appreciate any feedback that you have to offer and I'd love 
to see some of your recorded games in this level (mail 'em to 
the CRIS address, since the AOL address doesn't handle attached
files via the INET very well... unless you're on AOL or CRIS, 
then just e-mail them to ScottAllyn).

* Permissions *

Authors may NOT use this level as a base to build additional
levels without giving me credit for the original version, as
well as stating the changes made within a text file. Also, 
please don't recycle the MEDIDETH name with your modified 
version. I've found a few modified versions of my other levels 
being passed around with no mention that I created the original 
version, and that SUCKS! Please have a little respect for the 
time involved in creating this WAD by at least mentioning the 
original author!

You may distribute MEDIDETH.WAD in any electronic format (BBS,
Diskette, CD, etc) as long as you include this text file INTACT. 
If MEDIDETH.WAD is to be distributed under the MEDIDETH name,
the embedded ENDOOM directory entry MUST be included (that's the 
credits that get displayed after quitting the game. If MEDIDETH 
is not mentioned there, someone has been screwing with the 
level! Contact me and I'll send you a new copy).
