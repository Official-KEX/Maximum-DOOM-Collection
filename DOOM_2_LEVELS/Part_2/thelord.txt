Description             : Hey, I didn't include the .EXE files with the
                          ZIPFILE for nothing! Check them out!

Additional Credits to   : SySop James Shane. My monitor sucks so much I 
                          can't even find a program that lets me edit 
                          resolutions of 320x200x256 colors. 
                          Without James' help, I wouldn't have been able 
                          to use new graphics. James is also the sysop 
                          of Porky Piggin' BBS. Look for the number 
                          of the BBS levels.
