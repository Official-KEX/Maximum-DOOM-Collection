Description             : Purely deathmatch!  Designed to keep
                          you and your opponents on your toes.
                          In deathmatch mode everyone starts with
                          one of four weapons and you keep that
                          weapon...  until you die.  Ammo at one
                          end, health at the other, and plenty of
                          frags in between.  Watch your back, aim
                          well, and KEEP MOVING!
                          After testing several different setup
                          options, we came to the conclusion that
                          the best play was with Deathmatch 2.0 and
                          respawning monsters.  Try it like that!
                          It really keeps the action going...
                          The map contains every weapon, most of
                          of bonuses, and yes, there is an exit.
