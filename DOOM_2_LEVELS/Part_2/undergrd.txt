Description             : This is a DOOM II DEATHMATCH pwad.

                          Blast your way through old underground
                          stations and monster crawling streets.
                          Explore the long dark tunnels. Raid the
                          buildings, but watch your back!!.

                          There are plenty of monsters to kill before
                          the real fraggin' can begin, so this will
                          get you warmed up. If you don't want any
                          monsters, use the -nomonsters option when
                          loading.

                          P.S.   There is no EXIT!
                                 If you want the level to end use
                                 the -timer option when loading.

Info                    : This is my first 'released' pwad.
                          It was made for DOOM but I modified
                          it for DOOM II.
