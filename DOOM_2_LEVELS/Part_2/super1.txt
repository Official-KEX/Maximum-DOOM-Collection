Misc. Author Info       : This is NOT my first WAD, but I finally
                          decided to release something I've made.
                          This is my first release of something I
                          have done, and I'll probably put more out
                          soon.

Description             : This is a SUPER addition to MAP 01.  Most
                          of the original elements of MAP 01 are still
                          intact, but some changes have been made to
                          make this the ULTIMATE design for a Deathmatch
                          Showdown for 2-4 players, especially on
                          a place like DWANGO!  A few secrets
                          lie in this one so I'm not going to give it
                          all away, but if you wish to lock out the
                          BFG, backpack, and the two mega-spheres that
                          exist in this level, simply hit the switch
                          around the corner from the BFG.  You'll also
                          experience some moving music, great sound
                          effects, and a replacement title bar screen at
                          the bottom.
