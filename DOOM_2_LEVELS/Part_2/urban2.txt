Misc. Author Info       :

Description             :  Deathmatch level set in a Bladerunner-inspired
			   seamy urban core.  Fight in the open streets, 
			   seek refuge in buildings, duck through dark
			   alleys, and ambush your opponent in an abandoned 
			   subway station.  This level has lots of detail
			   with new sprites, flats, wall textures, and
			   graphics.  Cool lighting effects, a super shotgun
			   armory, lots of dark corners, a pit trap, neon
			   signs, city skyline and more.  Extensively
			   playtested and refined.  Weapons are strategi- 
			   cally placed and building layout punishes players
			   for camping in one spot too long.  Non-cooperative 
			   exit.  (Bring your hardware--the map itself is
			   fairly small for deathmatches with plenty of 
			   contact, but the open design of the city has a
			   fair number of visplanes).  Music is borrowed from 
			   Map08 of Doom2.  Zipfile includes DeuSF for a
			   clean install with no filmy residue like other
			   PWADs.

E-Z Installation:

 Unzip the files into your DOOM2 directory and run INSTALL.BAT 
 DeuSF will append the required sprites and flats from DOOM2.WAD
 to URBGFX.WAD.  Your DOOM2.WAD is *not* modified.  Alternate method
 if you have DeuTex: use DeuTex -merge URBGFX.WAD to add the 
 graphics to your DOOM2.WAD.  This is fast and requires little
 disk space but modifies DOOM2.WAD.  Restoration of DOOM2.WAD is
 easy with DeuTex -restore.  Safe for kids.
 
 After installation, run Doom2 thusly: 
 doom2 -file urban2.wad urbgfx.wad

* Future plans *

¯How 'bout adding some redefined sprites of police and/or armed security
drones ("Miscreant, HALT!") for target practice?  Heck, why stop there--why 
not a full Bladerunner theme conversion?  Any takers?   ;)

¯Until Quake arrives, Doom needs exhaust-belching, gas-guzzling, wide-tired, 
motorcycles to do battle upon.  Try running around the streets on this pwad
with -turbo switched on and you'll get the idea.  Now imagine chasing your
opponent down a long straightaway at 150mph with a side-mounted chaingun...
