Description             : I Built this level with the serious DOOMER in
                          mind.  Not to say that this is one of those
                          LAMER levels with 1000 Demons in 1 room. You
                          will have to really THINK in order to make it
                          through "THE-ZONE".  Great Puzzles and new
                          Techniques used throughout this HUGE level. 

Misc Game Info          : DOOM II WAD. This WAD is error free. It's been play
                          tested for over 20 hours. It should run fine on a
                          386 or a 486. It's been played on both.

Additional Credits to   : CHAPMAN, for his input, play testing and
                          pointing out ALL texture Misalignments :)
                          Special thanks goes to SLUG, for all the play
                          testing, 100's of times.
