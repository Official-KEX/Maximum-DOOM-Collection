------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 This is the second episode in Rambutt's DOOM. It has more modified levels 
 and original levels just like the first episode. 

 If you know the name of the wad that any of these levels came from or who 
 created them, drop me a line ! I want to credit to the people who did these !

 Also, I've added multi-player starts to all of these levels (deathmatch
 included !) and I also fixed some problems that I found, as well as fixing
 some problems that I added! So, if any of these levels are yours, I hope you 
 like what I did to them.

 Level        Wad        Description
  12        unknown      Confusing level with lots of twisty tunnels that 
                         lead to a HUGE area right before you exit.
  13         NEW!        Telefrags for fun!!
  14        unknown      The exit is right behind you at the beginning, but
                         you'll have to explore the whole level to find out
                         how to open it!
  15         NEW!        Modified e1m1 from the original DOOM!
  16         NEW!        This is a slightly modified e3m1 from DOOM I!
  17        unknown      Catch a movie before continuing the adventure.
  18        J_HTIC       Heretic e1m1 for DOOM 2 now with monsters!
  19         NEW!        Lots of open space and weapons. Check out those
                         L-shaped doors at the end.
  20         NEW!        Small level, but very deadly.


Other Wads By Rambutt:

#1.     Wad name = Rambutt1.zip
        This was the original release. It was a 9 level wad for the first
        DOOM game. Released on 4/11/95, along with "Rambutt's DOOM FAQ II"
        v0.04.

#2.     Wad name = Rambutt2.zip
        After deciding to finish the rest of Rambutt's DOOM for DOOM 2, I
        converted all of my DOOM I levels to DOOM II. This version has 2 more
        levels to balance out with the 11 levels in the first part of DOOM 2.
        Released on 4/19/1995, with v0.05 of "Rambutt's DOOM FAQ II"

        Bug-free version of Rambutt3.zip spawned on 4/27/1995.

Note: There will NOT be Heretic versions of the 2nd and 3rd episodes of
      Rambutt's Doom. (at least, not that I'm doing)
