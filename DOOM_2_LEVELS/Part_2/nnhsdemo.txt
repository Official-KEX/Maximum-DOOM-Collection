                to see how well it worked (pretty damn well, too!)

Credits:        
               Owen Williams (owenguy@world.std.com) -- I made this deathmatch
               wad, and I thought it would be best to include some demos
               to show it off.

               Peter Williams (no address) -- My 11 year old brother.  He's
               only been using the mouse for a week, so he's still over
               compensating (sp?).
