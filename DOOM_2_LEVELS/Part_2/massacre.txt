Description             : This is a pretty fast-paced deathmatch
                          level. It was made for 2 players. I
                          haven't tested 4 players. There is a 
                          floating cube on this level and the  
                          cube has no gliches. I didn't make the
                          cube the same way as the author of
                          FLOATCUB. It should be a very good
                          level for anyone. This level is a need
                          for everyone! 

Additional Credits to   : ID, Jeff Rabenhorst for Edmap, the 
                          author of Floatcub.wad, and some
                          friends for helping test this level
