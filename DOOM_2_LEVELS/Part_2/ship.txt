Authors may do whatever they want with this level, but it might be nice
to give me some credit if they use it as a basis for a new level.

Author's Note:

	This wad was created just to see how the concept would turn out.
	I am pleased with the finished product and I hope you will be, too.
	Exiting is no trouble (once you find it) and it is a little heavy
	with monsters until you get to know it, but it was designed for
	non-cooperative Deathmatch and you will find that it is best enjoyed
	in that mode.  Nothing can substitute for semi-intelligent opponents!
	Please send me comments, suggestions for improvement, or wad ideas
	that you would like to see come to fruition.  Thanks!
