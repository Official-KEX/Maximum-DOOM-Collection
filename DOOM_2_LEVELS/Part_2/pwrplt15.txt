Description             : A new twist on pwad deathmatch creation..
                          a PWAD *MADE* for team play! some of the stuff
                          you just can't get without a partner ( Like
                          the BFG ) The BFG is a Trap, you can get TO it
                          alone, but you can't LEAVE it alone. ::Grin::
                          ( Phrasing completely intentional )

                          The exit room has more than one switch, ONLY ONE
                          IS THE TRUE EXIT! the rest lower the ceiling...
                          ::Grin:: see how eager you are to run for the exit 
                          now coward...

          - New in 1.5
                          For some reason, 1.0 didn't work...
                          (maybe its because I forgot to rebuild the nodes
                          before I released it to the public? naaah....)
                          Anyhow, it works now. Made a few changes as you'll 
                          see....

* Extra Bonus stuff! *
I'm uploading two versions of 1.5, PWRPLT15.ZIP which is just
this file and the WAD, and PWRPCX15.ZIP, which is, the WAD, 
and a bunch of screen shots to help you along. 
The screen shots are in .PCX format ( taken with -devparm and f1 while
playing ) I recommend cshow to view them, as in all other viewers I tried,
(dcview, graphics workshop, MS Paintbrush, and Neopaint) it images were
either distorted or very tiny.
 The Pix File listing is as Follows:
 A-Map.PCX        -  The location of the computer map
 BFGhall.PCX      -  The entry way to the hall with the bfg,
                     careful, unless you have a partner, you 
                     won't leave that hallway with the bfg!
 BigUgly.PCX      -  One of the many Monsters in the level, still
                     alive and kicking.. ( Well, he'd kick if he
                     had legs, and he won't be alive for long )
 Careful.PCX      -  The last room, showing the first of the switches.
                     ( Hint, its neither of these 2 :) )
 DieFatBy.PCX     -  A dead Fat boy
 Doors.PCX        -  A Pair of secret doors
 Elevator.PCX     -  What I would've made into a true elevator if Doom was
                     a True 3D game. For now it has to suffice as the
                     illusion of one.
 GetUsed2.PCX     -  You'll get used to this room.. half the teleports
                     lead here ( Hint, In deathmatch, don't stand on the
                     landing pad very long.. )
 GoinDown.PCX     -  Another View of 'The Lift'
 Hello.PCX        -  Say hello, then goodbye, to the nice seargent.
 LiteHall.PCX     -  I am rather proud of the lighting in this room
 Mefirst.PCX      -  I wonder who'll get the shot off first? Me or him..
                     The tittle of this pix tells the story of what happened
 MegaSphr.PCX     -  The location of the only MegaSphere in the game.
 Outtammo.PCX     -  Aw crap.. down to a shotgun.
 PoolFDth.PCX     -  A neat looking Pool, with a Neat looking reward
 Pretty.PCX       -  Simply a nice shot of the first room, with bodies 
                     laying everywhere.. kinda brings a tear to an old
                     doomers eye... -Sniffle-
 Secret.PCX       -  You know where the room IS, but how do you GET to it?
 SwchBFG.PCX      -  The switch to open the hallway for the BFG
 TheHall.PCX      -  The longest hallway I've ever designed
 TheLift.PCX      -  One of the central Design features of this wad that 
                     stand out
