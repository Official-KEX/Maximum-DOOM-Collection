This is strictly Deathmatch. No monsters are included.
Plenty of weapons, fake walls, ambush areas.  Just about 
room has 2 exits with exception of the ammo rooms and
1 of the perches. In order to start player one has got 
to throw the switch directly in front of him. The slime 
doesn't damage because apparently nobody likes that in
Deathmatch so that's why.  There is no exit so either 
you can add one and wad merge with another one or just
play it till it hurts.  Obviously ID software has no 
idea i even exist no less support this wad. This is a 
DOOM 2 wad.  Unzip into your DOOM2 dir and to run its
-file megadeth.wad....you know the drill.
