Description             : *EXCELLENT* re-make of map 1. We included some 
                          great new sounds too... We really didnt add on 
                          much, we just took what was there and expanded 
                          on it..There is a hidden soul sphere..good luck!
                          (And maybe a Megasphere. I think I forgot.)
