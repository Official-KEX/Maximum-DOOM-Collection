Single Player           : Yes, just take a look...lots of mean monsters...
                          Can be played and won but not easily...
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : What's the point?  Well if you want to...Actually,
                          it might take two of you to get them all...
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : YES! Kill yer buddies...very nice 3 player and
                          hectic 4 player.  I designed this one for a cozy
                          frag-fest in a smaller area than fraggan.wad.  It
                          has plenty of secrets and plenty of stuff.  Watch 
                          your back when teleporting.  There is an exit by 
                          candles [north and south] and it takes two to use.
