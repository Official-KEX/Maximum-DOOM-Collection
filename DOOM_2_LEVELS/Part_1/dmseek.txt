* Special Notes *

1).  This level provides an exit room (denoted by the standard DOOM type
     exit door texture).  This allows players to view their final
     FRAG statistics at the end of the level.

2).  A special armory area is provided where one can stock up on all
     ammo and other supplies in quantity.  The weapons on top of the
     pedestal in the center of the armory cannot be reached by any
     normal method during the course of game play.  There is a deathmatch
     starting point in that location for specifically for that purpose
     and is designed to be a "special treat".

3).  Due to the complexity of the "view" across the play area from
     certain windows/perches, the game can be a bit sluggish if you are
     limited to a 9600 bps connection.	In this instance, adding the
     parameter	  -turbo 125   to the SERSETUP line is recommended.
     This is not necessary at speeds above 9600 bps or on a network.
