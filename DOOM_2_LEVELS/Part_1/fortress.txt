Title                   : Fortress of Doom (2)

Misc. Author Info       : I own a cat named Sabre. He "maus". :)

Description            : The baddies who you beat up in Doom 2 are not 
                         completely destroyed. The last remaining faction 
                         captured and took up residence in an old castle. 
                         You have been sent to retake it.

                         This level will work with single player, cooperative,
                         deathmatch, and altdeathmatch modes. If you can't 
                         figure out how to get back up to the outer rim, there
                         are stair-ladders on the top, sides, and bottom of the
                         map.
