Description             : Prepare to enter the Firestorm. Select your 
                          weapons combination and enter the grim 
                          deathmatch arena. Slug it out with your  
                          competitors and a furious horde of enemies      
                          while trying to gain access to hidden caches 
                          of weapons and power ups.       
                          
                          Network play requires cooperation between
                          two players to end level. Level was designed
                          to be played as a deathmatch with respawing on, 
                          providing maximum level playability and 
                          carnage :) If you play solo, do it in 
                          nightmare mode.
