Description             : The best thing about these levels is they're fairly
                                straight-forward.  That is there's no find 
                                the key, spend 20 minutes looking for where
                                to use it, 20 seconds of death-dealing, find 
                                a secret switch and so on.  That's not to say 
                                that this kind of level doesn't have its 
                                place, it does, but i don't design that.  
                                I've had enough of that from DOOM II.
                          These levels (i think) are original.  I haven't 
                                really played anything like them.  Anyway, 
                                please see what you think, and let me know.

                             -------

                          OK.  You were one of the unlucky ones, you weren't
                                killed.  Trying to rid that sector of Caco-
                                demons was useless, and you knew it.  Command
                                HQ knew better and sent you in at the head of
                                a bunch of inexperienced soldiers, most of 
                                them useless.  All are dead. Except one who
                                was captured. You.

                          They've got you bricked up in a small room.  You      
                                thought you had an idea why.  After you found 
                                the pistol there you knew why.  Rumors had
                                infiltrated back to base that the Cacodemons
                                liked to play soldier bating with any captured
                                soldiers.  You know what's in store.

                          A feeling wells up in your gut you know to be fear.
                                You look at the tiny weapon in your hand and
                                groan.  You'll be lucky to take out one. All 
                                is lost.  You wait for death.

                          Visions of those red bastards killing killing killing
                                roar through your mind, slowly enraging you to
                                accept the inevitable.  Surfacing through 
                                these thoughts of death, however, is another 
                                thought, revenge.  Not with a pistol.  You'd
                                walk through hell for a shotgun.  Maybe you
                                will...
                  
                          NOTE:-  Level 3 is a bit more unprofessional than
                                  the rest.  It originally was a DOOM level.
                                  It's good however.  SO PLAY IT!!  Play them
                                  all.  You'll feel better.

                          HINTS:- (1) Play at least skill 3
                                  (2) DON'T CHEAT!!!!
                                  (3) There is no third hint
                                  (4) Or fourth

Cooperative 2-4 Player  : Yes, 4 players, but i haven't tested it
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : No
Difficulty Settings     : Kind of, settings 1 & 2 i used for playtesting so 
                                there ain't much there in some parts. Boring
New Sounds              : No
New Graphics            : No
New Music               : No
Demos Replaced          : Err, i didn't have time to find something to let me 
                                replace the demos, i have however included a
                                separate demo of level 1 if you get stuck. To 
                                run it get in your DOOM2 directory and type:
                                
          doom2 -file <path of WAD dir>\higher.wad -playdemo level1.lmp

                                at the prompt.  If you keep your WADs in the 
                                DOOM2 directory, then u can omit the WAD path.
                                I think you have to have the lmp's (demos) in
                                your DOOM2 directory.

                                If any1 would be so good as to let me know 
                                how to add lmp's to a wad i'd be very happy
