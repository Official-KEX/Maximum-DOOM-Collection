Description:              I hate the BFG.  No skill involved with it. 
                          Some players like the mass destruction it
                          causes, so I created this level with those
                          players in mind, and it's actually quite fun.
                          This level was designed to be small, fast and
                          furious.  Non-stop fraggin action, even with 
                          2 players.

Additional Credits to   : Steve Silvester and his friend James for 
                          playtesting.  Thanks for the easy frags, guys.
                          
                          ID Software for the game we all love to play.
