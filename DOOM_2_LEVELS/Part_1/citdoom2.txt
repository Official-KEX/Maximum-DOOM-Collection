 * Misc. Notes *

-This is version 2.2,an updated version of v2.0 for Doom 1 for use with 
 Doom ][ only!(confusing,huh?);I changed some of the textures(I had to,
 since Doom ][ doesn't use all of Doom 1's textures) and put in a few 
 new ones(armoury),added the super shotgun,new monsters,more difficulty 
 levels and a couple of switches.
