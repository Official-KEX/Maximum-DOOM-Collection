Description             : CROSSING ACHERON is the second level in the INFERNO 
			  series.  Having passed through DANTE'S GATE and 
			  survived, you now find yourself in a keep on the
			  shores of the river Acheron. This is the second 
			  leg of the journey in your search for Beatrice. 
			  Your guide, Virgil, is nowhere to be found. 
			  "He's buggered off!" you think to yourself; but 
			  you have no time now to even think: you are
			  immediately challenged by several Demons, and in 
			  the distance you hear the eerie purring of the 
			  Arch-Vile. (Just be sure not to stare at him for 
			  too long before you start running.)  As usual, 
			  you dispatch what fiends you may and begin the 
			  task at hand.

			  Your goal?  To get the hell out of this place as
			  quickly as possible and find your beloved Beatrice.
			  You only hope that she has already passed through
			  this hell-hole to a safer haven beyond.  If only
			  you could hold her in your arms again, you know
			  what you would say:

			  "Give me some sugar, Babe."
	 		  
			  CROSSING ACHERON (pronounced 'ak eron) is the second
			  level in a series that began with DANTE'S GATE. The
			  third is VIRGIL'S LEAD. For any of the two or three 
			  of you out there who have read Dante Alighieri's 
			  THE DIVINE COMEDY -- or even only "Inferno" -- 
			  I'm sure you've been able to appreciate the many 
			  allusions to this work in DOOM. I have tried to 
			  take a tack of my own along the same lines. (I do
			  this not only because I think the idea is neat, but
			  so that people will think that I'm very clever.)
			  I'm not so na‹ve as to expect everyone to rush out
			  and get a copy of "Inferno" (I mean, it IS pretty
			  tedious stuff, at times), but it's well worth the
			  read -- and a little patience is a virtue that is
			  often well-rewarded.

			  (By the way: Acheron is a river in Hell (basically).
			  But don't look for any rivers in here: I tried it
			  several different ways and just wasn't convinced.)

			  Thanks.  Hope you like it.

Instructions		: Put ACHERON2.WAD in your DOOM directory, type
			  "doom2 -file acheron2.wad -warp 3 -skill <#>"
			  (Or, to play moderately at first, also put the file
			  ACHE2.BAT in your DOOM directory and type ACHE2.)
  			  To play the DEMO, just type DOOM2 -file acheron2.wad,
			  sit back, and enjoy the show.
			  
Disclaimer		: I assume no responsibility for anything of any sort
			  in any way, shape, or form--now, then, henceforeward 
			  in this life (or the next several) for any screw-ups
			  or even minor inconveniences this PWAD causes you,
			  your family, your relatives, friends, ancestors,
			  associates, employers, pets, neighbors, lovers,
			  congressional representatives, nor any other person--
			  living, dead, or undead -- that you have or will ever
			  have any contact with in even the slightest form.
			  This PWAD has been tested and tested ad infinitum, so
			  it shouldn't mess with your computer or anything else
			  remotely associated with it.  But if it DOES, then
			  that's the way the cookie crumbles. Don't come cryin'
			  to me.  It must be something YOU did.  If you don't
			  like it, lump it. (I ran out of clich‚s.)
