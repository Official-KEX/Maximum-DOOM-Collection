Description             : I got the idea for this when a friend of mine said
                          that Cyber Demons were too easy to kill.. well, he
                          doesn't say that anymore!!!  :)  5 of the 6 levels
                          contain 1 or more Cyber Demons, please contact me
                          if you can pass all 6 levels without cheat codes!!

                          This is CYNOFUN.WAD with an extra challenging level
                          and music added to all 6 levels...
                          
Additional Credits to   : Ben Jordan for saying Cyber Demons were too easy,
                          Dracos and Stilleto for help with the music
