* Important Notes *

        Danzg11a is a VERY small level designed to provide for extremely 
intense Deathmatches.  I've included support for various modes of play as 
follows:
        
        1.  Original Deathmatch rules ("I'm Too Young To Die" and "Hey, Not 
            Too Rough" support this) 
            
        2.  Deathmatch 2.0 rules ("Hurt Me Plenty" supports this) 
        
        3.  What I call "Expert" mode ("Ultraviolent" and "Nightmare" support 
            this)  
        
Original Deathmatch and Deathmatch 2.0 are basically the same setup with 
minor variations in ammo/health placement.  Expert mode has very little 
health and ammo, but DOES include every weapon in the level (including 
the BFG).  Use Expert mode if you want access to the more powerful weapons.
        I've also included monster support - monsters are placed 
strategically to add spice to the game.  Usually players don't need this in
a three- or four-player game, but sometimes a two-person game can get a 
little slow.  Either way you like it, BE SURE TO INCLUDE THE RESPAWN OPTION
WHEN USING MONSTERS in your Deathmatches.
        Also note that this level does NOT involve a cooperative exit.  
Pushing the exit button will open a wall BEHIND one of the rocket launcher 
lifts; the exit is in a small room there.  Make SURE you're ready to leave 
when you hit the exit button.
        Please take a walk through this level before you actually use it in 
Deathmatch.  While danzg11a is extremely straightforward, it's always nice to
get a feel for a new level before you begin.  I'm open to any comments/  
suggestions you may have, so please send me email!
        Finally, if anyone uses this pwad who plays over a LAN (with three 
or four people), please make an LMP file and send it to me!  I've rarely had
the chance to see more than two people in this level, and would like to 
see the action.  Thanks for using Danzig!
