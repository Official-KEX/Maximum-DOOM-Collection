Title                   : Frags For All!
                          A Deathmatch WAD Series designed specifically for
                          four player deathmatch play. (DOOM II)

Misc. Author Info       : Crazed and devoted DOOM nut who's in search of the
                          perfect four player deathmatch WAD for network
                          play. Spends more time on DOOM related activities
                          than would like to admit :)
Description             :"Lock the target
                          Bait the line
                          Spread the net
                          and FRAG the man!"
                          (To paraphrase Front 242's "HeadHunter")

MAP01 - Free For All    : Converted from my original DOOM I deathmatch wad
                          This was my first "real" deathmatch wad and still
                          remains as one of my favourites. All weapons are
                          present, but going for them puts you in a position
                          to be fragged. Fast paced and crazy.
MAP02 - Skulker         : This one is Andrew Moore's favourite (fellow
                          co-worker and DOOM nut). You skulk around in a
                          dark maze searching for your opponent. Not a very
                          high-frag level but it lends itself nicely for some
                          long distance rocket fights or shotgun battles.
                          The catwalks also make gameplay more interesting by
                          being able to sneak up on an unsuspecting opponent.
MAP03 - Hunter          : A very simple rocket WAD. A very high "Negative
                          Frag" level if you have four players and have an
                          itchy trigger finger.
MAP04 - Death To All    : Made this level while totally smashed at an office
                          party. Had an entire office full of drunk crazees
                          who wanted to see how long it could take me to
                          design a deathmatch WAD. Took me an hour to build
                          this one and we played it well into the wee hours
                          of the morning. This one is a VERY HIGH FRAG level
                          and with four players, it's just INSANE!!! This is
                          my best "Heart-Pounding-Sweat-Building" level to
                          date. Big thanks go out to my Ingram Micro,
                          Symantec, Microsoft and Delrina reps for cheering
                          me on while I slaughtered the other people in
                          the office...
MAP05 - Carnage         : Was fooling around with some different ideas in
                          this one. There are diagonal coridoors connecting
                          four outside rooms and this one makes for
                          interesting play. There is a hidden warp in the
                          centre courtyard where the rocket launcher is
                          which leads to a lift to a megasphere.
MAP06 - DeadZone        : A bit of a departure for me. I was messing around
                          with hidden areas and sniping positions. This one
                          revolves around a centre room with a lift to a
                          rocket launcher and around the rocket launcher
                          are four floating megaspheres. You have to see this
                          one. This one is probably my best deathmatch WAD
                          and with four players, it kicks!

Base                    : New levels from scratch
Editor(s) used          : 1DEU-II, DEU2C, EdMap 1.?
Known Bugs              : On MAP06, as you're going up the rocket launcher
                          lift, the floors from the invisible sector briefly
                          "Bleed" but go away and soon as it's out of your
                          line of sight. Couldn't find a way around this

Thanx to the entire id crew for releasing such a great game. It was worth
every penny I spent on it and has given me countless hours of enjoyment
with network and modem play. I look forward to spending my money on Quake
when it ships in 4th quarter '95 and hope it lives up to the hype.

If you have any comments about these levels, please e-mail me. Tell me what
you think and if I get good enough response, I'll probably design some more.
