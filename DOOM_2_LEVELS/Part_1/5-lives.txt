Hi there......

WARNING!!!!!!
if you ever want to play doom2 to at its normal difficulty again
make a copy of your doom2.exe file before doing the rest of this.
you do this by typing from your doom2 directory.
copy doom2.exe c:\
or on to a disk, or in to any other directory that you choose.
if you dont, you will have to reinstall doom2 to go back to its original
difficulty level.
when you want to go back to doom2's original difficulty just copy the 
doom2.exe file back into the doom2 directory.
-------------------------
If your unfamiliar with using dehacked.exe here is how you do it.
-------------------------
#1 unzip all the files in the 5-lives.zip to your doom2 directory like this.
pkunzip 5-lives.zip c:\doom2
if your doom2 directory is somewhere else then just give the path 
that your computer uses for doom2.
#2 go to your doom2 directory and type dehacked -load 5-lives.deh
#3 to play the level type doom2 -file 5-lives.wad

Have fun!!!!!!
