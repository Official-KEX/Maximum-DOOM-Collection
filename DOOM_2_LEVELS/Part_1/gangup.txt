Description             :A Deathmatch only wad for Doom2. Not very big, and 
                         It's easy to find the other people. It has four cubie
                         holes for each player to start in. Each person gets 
                         a shotgun and a chaingun. If your lucky or unlucky 
                         you could start in a sealed off room, that teleports 
                         you to the fort in the middle. (You can get in from 
                         the outside, theres a hint there.) In the fort you 
                         can get lots of ammo, butt only two health Bottles. 
                         So the poeple outside can gang up on the person 
                         inside, or you can just fight it out all the time. Up 
                         to you. There is no Exit. Sorry. Couldn't find a fair place
                         to put one.
