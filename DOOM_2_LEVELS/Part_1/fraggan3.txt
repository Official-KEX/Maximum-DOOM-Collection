* Play Information *

Game                    : DOOM II
Level #                 : MAP1
Single Player           : Yes, just to take a look...don't think i put any 
                          monsters in...[well, only a few...]
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : What's the point?
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : YES! Kill yer buddies...very nice 3 player and
                          hectic 4 player.  Lots of action centered around the
                          rocket launcher platform, and some in the secret 
                          hallways.  Watch out for the blind hallways, people
                          pop out of walls.  There is an exit, by the candles, 
                          but it takes two to operate.  This one has been a 
                          hit so far, so enjoy!........[woof]
