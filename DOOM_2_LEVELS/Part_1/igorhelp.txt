        This file includes a few tips for playing igor7a.wad.  I want to be
sure that nobody has any trouble finding exits, bonuses, etc.

                                                        
* EXITS *

Map01 - cooperative (push the button out in the plasma courtyard to open the
                    exit door)

Map02 - single is easily possible (BOTH buttons must be pushed to open BOTH
                                  exit doors)

Map03 - cooperative (push the button in the small room/alcove at the far east 
                    side of the level to open the exit bars)

Map04 - cooperative (one player MUST be down in the "prep room" and push BOTH
                    buttons (not simultaneously, but rapidly); one button 
                    opens a wall in the base of one of the LARGE gray pillars 
                    outside, and the other button opens the exit door behind 
                    that wall)

Map05 - single (the exit is directly behind you when you start or come back
               to life)

Map06 - cooperative (push the button up on the left-hand ledge where the blur 
                    sphere is to open the exit door down near the corridor 
                    with the lamps recessed in the walls; this will in turn
                    open a door back up on the left-hand ledge (with the blur 
                    sphere) to reveal a teleporter; go through the teleporter 
                    and push the exit button)

Map07 - single is possible (push the exit button in the long corridor 
                           (running vertically on the map) to open the exit 
                           door in the northeastern "green" room; if you run 
                           like hell you can make it by yourself)

Map08 - single (simply push the button behind the plasma gun lift to exit)

Map09 - single is possible (push the exit button in the center column of the
                           small outside structure to open the exit door)

Map10 - single is possible (push the first exit button to open a door leading
                           to another button; push the second button to lower
                           two walls outside, revealing a Final Enemy in the
                           northwest corner of the temple and a BFG in the
                           southeast corner (on skill levels 1-3); use the 
                           BFG to kill the Final Enemy and end the level (you
                           will have to aim carefully - try other weapons for
                           variety)


* Misc. *

Map01 - 1) push the green button and run up the northwestern narrow stairs to 
           gain access to the outside ledges

        2) in the (initially) dark room, there's a switch near the easternmost
           door which turns ON the lights, and a switch near the westernmost
           door which turns OFF the lights 

Map02 - 1) there is a bonus behind the door (marked with a candle) at the end
           of the ledge WITHOUT an impaled soldier 

        2) open the large wooden door and push the switch DIRECTLY to your
           right to gain access to a weapon

        3) a switch on the wall in the central room lowers a lift to gain
           access to the center weapons platform

Map03 - 1) at the far eastern side of the map, push one of the buttons on
           the wall to open the door directly across the hall; this will 
           reveal another button which opens a door BACK across that hall 

        2) there is a secret door on the southern side of the cacodemon cage
           (check your map for a yellow line revealing its location)

        3) there are weapon(s) on the south side INSIDE the cacodemon cage
           (down in the acid - use the teleporter to get back out)

Map04 - everything should be obvious

Map05 - 1) push the button on the outside of the raised tan/brown platform 
           (outdoors) to lower the lift (at the top of the stairs) with a 
           plasma rifle

Map06 - 1) go through the teleporter near the large door to get the rocket 
           launcher

        2) push the button down in the lower corridors (south side of the map)
           to open the small door to the left of the button

Map07 - 1) push the button near the rocket launcher platform to lower the
           platform around the rocket launcher; get on the platform and grab
           the rocket launcher 

Map08 - 1) push the button across from the plasma rifle/supershotgun lift to 
           open the door (with the gargoyle face) at the top of the stairs

        2) push the red skull on the wall up in the small southwestern room
           of the building to lower the lift with the rocket launcher 
           (leading outside)

        3) push the gargoyle switches (one at the bottom of the double stair-
           case, the other out on the southern ledge of the building) to 
           raise the stairs and give access to the outer "circular" ledge

        4) activate the lift on the southern side of the building and QUICKLY
           run around to the front to gain access to a soul sphere in one of
           the columns supporting the porch overhang

Map09 - everything should be obvious

Map10 - 1) to open a door from INSIDE the central room, walk on the lowest
           stair ACROSS THE ROOM from the door you want to open

        2) to kill the Final Enemy you must aim carefully with the BFG (line-
           of-sight) up into the cage on the northwest corner of the temple:   


                                 |
             (outer temple wall) |
                                 |
                                 |  x (Final Enemy)
                                 |  |
            (line of site)        \ |
                        __ __ __ __ \ __ __ x (Final Enemy)
                                    | \ __ __ __ __ __ __
                                    |    (outer temple wall) 
                                    |
                                    |
                                    |
                               (line of site)

        the Final Enemy (there are actually two, but you only need to kill
        one) is located along the inside edge of the temple walls; use the 
        above diagram to help aim your BFG shots (you CAN use other weapons,
        but the BFG works best)
