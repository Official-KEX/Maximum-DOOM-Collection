Title                   : Gore Galore (for DOOM 2)

Release Date            : 12/12/94

Misc. Author Info       : computer science major and Net-DOOM addict at 
                          Rutgers U.; this is my first WAD so bug reports,
                          criticisms, & suggestions for improvement would
                          be greatly appreciated; plz send me feedback via
                          email; this is the second (and probably final)
                          release of the level;  I believe that I have 
                          taken care of all the bugs that existed in the 
                          first release (a few missing textures, etc..);
                          I have also added a few small things to spice up
                          the level and improved textures in several rooms;
                          I would suggest copying GOREG2.WAD over GOREG.WAD
                          and deleting GOREG2.WAD since you will no longer
                          need the original version.  The Music/SFX WAD
                          (GOREGSND.WAD) has not changed.

Description             : This level is designed especially for DeathMatch
                          2.0, but it is also an excellent single-player
                          experience (although it will take a DOOM guru to
                          beat it on Ultra-Violence).  At first, the level 
                          will seem rather large for a DM level, but I can 
                          assure you that once all the players become 
                          familiar with the map's layout, this level provides
                          the ultimate DeathMatch environment.  There are 
                          many intricacies present which are not essential
                          for a simple rowdy DM game, but they will truly 
                          enhance the game for those who take the time to
                          figure them out.  Have fun!
