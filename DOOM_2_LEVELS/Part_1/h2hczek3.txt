Misc. Author Info     : I spend more time with wad-building than playing now.

Description           : This is the final version of the third part in the
                        CZECH SERIES. Since the beta was good, I just threw
                        in a couple of monsters. If you decide to play UV,
                        be carefull with ammo. Sometimes you will have to run
                        into fire for more shells.

                        This was built for altdeath. Playing solo or in co-op
                        will close windows and block some passages that are
                        opened during deathmatch.
