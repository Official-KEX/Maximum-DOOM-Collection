HERETIK V1.1
DAMONWARE NON-INC.

IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE V1.0, JUST COPY THESE FILES IN PLACE OF THE ORIGINAL
HERETIK FILES AND READ THE REST OF THIS FILE...

SOME FRIENDS AND I PLAY HERETIC ON THE SAME COMPUTER AND I FOUND IT TO BE
EXTREMELY INCONVENIENT TO HAVE 1 OR 2 SAVE GAMES EACH. HERETIK WILL SHUFFLE 
SAVE GAMES FOR YOU SO EVERYONE GETS THEIR OWN SET OF 6 (COUNT 'EM!) SAVE
GAME SLOTS.

HERE'S HOW IT WORKS:

HERETIK [SAVGAMEDIR] [ANY OTHER COMMAND LINE OPTIONS...] [] [] [] [] [] []
HERETIK [COMMAND LINE OPTIONS...LIKE REGULAR HERETIC.EXE...MAYBE...] [] []

[SAVGAMEDIR] IS THE DIRECTORY NAME HERETIK WILL CREATE TO STORE YOUR SAVE
GAMES (WE USE OUR NAMES) IN THE FIRST TIME. EVERY TIME AFTERWARDS, IT
WILL MOVE THE SAVE GAMES FROM THERE FOR USE IN HERETIC. YOU GET THE IDEA...

YOU MAY WANT TO CHANGE THE FILE NAME TO HERETIC.BAT, SO IT RUNS ANYTIME YOU
CRANK UP HERETIC. IF YOU ONLY RUN THE FILE NAME WITH NO COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
OR WITH REGULAR i.d./RAVEN COMMAND LINES IT WILL SKIP THE FILE SHUFFLE AND 
SOLEY RUN HERETIC. (I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE REGISTERED VERSION YET, SO I TRIED 
TO INCLUDE ALL THE REGULAR COMMAND LINE OPTIONS. IF YOU KNOW A NEW ONE OR 
HAVE AN @FILE ETC. ETC. JUST COPY THE "IF" LINE AND ADD WHATEVER YOU NEED.)

DO I ACTUALLY NEED TO PUT A DISCLAIMER IN HERE? IF YOU HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE
IN DOOM-TYPE AFTERMARKET SOFTWARE YOU KNOW THE SPIEL...MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A
FIRE EXTINGUISHER HANDY :)

SPECIAL THANKS TO i.d. SOFTWARE FOR THE INCREDIBLE DOOM ENGINE THAT SEEMS
TO BE POWERING ANY 3D? SHOOT 'EM UP WORTH A DAMN AND RAVEN SOFTWARE FOR
ADDING GREAT TOUCHES TO THE ORIGINAL EXPERIENCE.

                                                      T.A.D.-
                                                      DAMON SERKLAND


P.S. IF WHILE USING HERETIK.BAT YOU HAPPEN TO DISCOVER A FILE CALLED 
     CRASH.BAT DO NOT DELETE IT. RUN HERETIK.BAT BECAUSE HERETIC APPARENTLY
     CRASHED, AND THE .BAT WASN'T ABLE TO COMPLETELY SHUFFLE THE FILES...
     IN SHORT, ALL THE CARNAGE YOU INFLICTED MAY BE LOST!!!!! (WE DON'T WANT
     THAT....DO WE?)
