Description:

      .------------------------------------------------.
     (| Same as HIPPIE1.WAD, but converted for Doom ][ |)
      `------------------------------------------------'

    A few big rooms, a few small rooms, and some 
    tunnels.  Lots of wide open spaces, and some good 
    ambush-points.  I'd like to see it for team play.

    Basically, this wad was created while showing a friend 
    how to use DEU.  I think it makes a dandy Deathmatch wad, 
    although it's only been tested with two players.  At the 
    hardest level, it's got two cyberdemons.  The middle 
    levels have a cacodemon or two and a spiderdemon.  
    The easisiest level is best for using `-respawn', as 
    it only has one imp, some troopers, and some 
    sergents.
    
    Weapon-wise, it's got one of each weapon, except the 
    chainsaw.  The BFG is stuck on a small ledge behind a 
    cyberdemon, so it's not all that accessable...  I've 
    heard that big monsters and BFGs only ruin a level, 
    but I feel that this one works.
