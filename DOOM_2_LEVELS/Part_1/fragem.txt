Description             : This is a wad designed for deathmatch 2
(-Altdeath)
   Carefully tuned with feedback from deathmatch fanatics through hours of
   play testing. Eight towers in a large arena provide a variety of weapons
   and great sniping. Slots and windows in the towers allow for shooting
   into all other towers, but watch out! "Random" transporters and sneak 
   doors make for surprise entrances. One imp and chaingunner in level.
   Use -respawn for a little extra fun. Cooperative exit.

Additional Credits to   : The Avtech Doomheads: Paul, Charlie, Jim,
                          Chuck and Ken for play testing.
