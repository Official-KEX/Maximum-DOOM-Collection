   For Beginers:  To load, copy icenite2.wad into your Doom2 directory.
At the command prompt type "doom2 -file icenite2.wad"    The level will
load in level 1 of Doom2.


    For Everyone:  Ice Nightmare 2 is a made from scratch level for 
DOOM2(HELL ON EARTH).  It will not run with DOOM 1.  It is a tough level
with interesting rooms and open areas.  Many of the rooms take some thought 
and planning.  You do the room the right way and you can get out with barely
a scratch.  Do it the wrong way and you're IMPMEAT.  There is enough ammo 
for all difficulty levels, but don't waste it or you will run out.  Try not 
to use the rockets or plasma unless you have to because you will probably 
need them later.  That goes double for UV mode.  

    If you like the level let me know.  If you think it sucks, tell me that 
too.  How else can I make a better level without input from all the Doomsters
out there.  I can be reached at michaelst@aol.com

    Have fun and lets toast some baddies.  Also check out my other level
for Doom1 - Icedeath.wad.
