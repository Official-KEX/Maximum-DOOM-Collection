Description             : This is my very first attempt to create a Deathmatch
                          wad. I borrowed some ideas off of a few popular DM
                          wads and also brainstormed myself. When the wad was
                          in preliminary stage, I released a *beta* of my wad
                          called Foxer16.wad on my BBS for my users to test 
                          play. I had no idea is was going to be this good!!!
                          Finally, this release of Foxer.wad is the final
                          version. IMHO it is 10x better than what it was in
                          beta form!! PLAY IT LOUD on The Playing Fields BBS!!
