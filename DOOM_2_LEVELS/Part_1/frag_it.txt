Description             : Deathmatch level designed for 3-4 players,
                          but some testplayers thought it was also 
                          playable with only 2 players. Is it good? 
                          Well, we sure had fun testing it! The first 
                          test game lasted quite a while (2 of the 4 
                          players over 100 frags). Textures etc. are
                          aligned (this level is not one of those that 
                          consists of 4 rooms glued together with random 
                          textures on the walls). 
                          Furthermore: You won't find a plasma or BFG in 
                          here, my friends and I prefer conventional 
                          weapons. :)
                          The rest of the weapons are available as well
                          as a soul sphere, an armor and some extra 
                          ammo and goodies.
                          My recommendation is that this level be played
                          at alt-death (respawning weapons) because the
                          amount and placement of weapons comes out best
                          in that mode.
                          If you have any comment or find any bugs please
                          send mail to the e-mail adress above.
                          If you like it tell me! if you don't, also tell
                          me, but be sure to mention what you don't like
                          and why, so I can use the feedback in my later
                          trials at wad-editing.
                          Have a blast!

                          And of course to Annet my great girlfriend, 
                          who had to go to bed alone every night, 
                          because I was up editing. (This is probably
                          the reason why she hates the game so much).
