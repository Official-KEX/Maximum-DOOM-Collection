Description             : This level was designed for a good deathmatch
                          game where you can expirence fragging more often
                          than just once in a while. I added a few monsters
                          incase you would like to play Deathmatch w/monsters
                          on skill 5 so they would respawn (for a lil' twist)
                          The rest of the wad is explainatory and easy so you
                          should find yourself fimular with that wad on your
                          first time.      
           
Misc Game Info          : DOOM II WAD. This WAD has a little bug on mini-tower
                          in the middle, but you shouldn't notice it because
                          you'll be too busy fragging other doom wanna be's.
                          This WAD has tested for over 1+ hours ;). 
                          It should run fine on a 386 or a 486. 
                          If it does not work, then your computer is SCREWED, 
                          if it isn't your computer, then YOUR SCREWED! ;)
