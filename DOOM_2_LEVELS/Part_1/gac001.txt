	If you play single player you are going to need the 'idclip' code

iddqd - god
idclip - no clip
idkfa - ammo
idbehold plus letter - s-v-i-r-a-l
iddt - map enhance
idclev01 - warp to map01


2 And 4 Player only note : This level was designed to run over a modem, network,
			   or dwango either 2 or 4 players. If you run it 1 or 
			   3 players, one person will not be able to move. Also
			   due to the same restraints on Co-operative, you must
			   have 4 players for deathmatch.
