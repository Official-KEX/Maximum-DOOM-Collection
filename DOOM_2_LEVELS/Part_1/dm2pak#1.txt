DM2Pak#1.wad

The following is a compilation of wads collected from,  everywhere I guess.  Most of these levels have been altered slightly to fix textures, add a few bad guys, change strategy on some levels, and basically include exits.  All skill levels are supported in most levels and all are playable in any mode (even if the originals were not).  The following is a list of documentation of the original authors (known) and the name of the original level was found under.  Some levels did not contain documentation so obviously the names of the creators is not included.  If you have been omitted or know the name of the original author, please drop a note and you/they will be included.

This wad replaces the DM2_1-16.wad and fixes all bugs that were in the original wad.  This wad was uploaded to AOL on Feb 20, 1995 and is error free.  It has been tested on numorous occasions with many rockets, cells, bullets and shells.  The levels for this wad are as follows:

A few hints-Level 5 was modified to make the pilar blocking the rocket launcher and plasma gun.  A switch in the room on left (if you are facing the pilar from the exit door) drops the pilar and the switch in the room on the right will raise the pilar.  This is fun to do to someone you see making a run for it.  

Level 7 -- The exit is the wall with the lights on it.  No switch just press open button.

Level 15--The exit for the ship level is in the crate room above the crates to your left as you enter the room.  One switch drops the floor, the other one exits.  

Teleporters -- Try walking into them from different directions on some levels.

All DM2PAK wads will be small to medium in size and designed to play like this wad.  So if you don't like what I did to this one, don't get the others, you'll hate them too.  Look for Dm2Pak#2, Dm2Pak#3, and Dm2Pak#4 soon on AOL.  Dm2Pak#2 is just about finished play testing for errors and should be on AOL approx.  2-3 weeks after this wad appears.  In short, I will upload Dm2Pak#2 at the end of February and a new Dm2Pak# each of the following months until I run out of wads, get really hooked on Dark Forces, or I get a life.
