Description             : A scientist is trying to create human life. 
			  People say that he is mad. One evening he sits 
			  in the local pub with a spooky hysteric smile     
			  on his face. He is mumbling something about 
			  success. Succes it is, but one thing is terribly 
			  wrong. It is not human, not human at all!! 
					    *  *  *
			  The door is locked behind you!! Now there is only
			  one way out!! When you turn around the corner you 
			  realise that the scientist really IS MAD!!
