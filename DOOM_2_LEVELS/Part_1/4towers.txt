Thanks very much to these Beta Testers that helped me test and 
improve my first ever DOOM Level!

A GREAT BIG THANKS TO MY SISTER FOR HELPING ME WITH MANY IDEAS
AND THE COLORATION OF THIS LEVEL.  I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT 
WITHOUT HER!  

Thanks goes to Kevin Roels for supplying me with Deu2c, BSP12X,
and other miscellaneous utilities which made this level possible.

Also, thanks to Shadow Hawk for helping me with sector closing 
in Deu2c.  Thanks for supplying me with NWT!  What a great utility!

* Play Information *

Level                   : Map 01
Single Player           : No
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : No
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : Yes (Preferrably 3 or 4 players)
Difficulty Settings     : Use "NIGHTMARE" difficulty.  Turbo 130 
                          is suggested.  Use a higher Turbo setting
                          if the WAD seems slow in a 4 player game.

New Graphics            : No
New Music               : Yes
Demos Replaced          : None 

* Construction *

Base                    : New level from scratch!
Editor(s) used          : Deu2c v6.66á and the BSP12X node building 
                          utility made by Colin Reed.
Known Bugs              : Deu2c has a bug when switching through
                          the modes with the TAB key.  The program
                          will sometimes exit to DOS when TAB key
                          is used.  

                          Memory available greatly decreases after
                          node building.  Using BSP12X should alleviate
                          this problem.  Answer no when Deu2c asks
                          you to build the nodes, exit to DOS, and use
                          BSP to build them.  
          
Known Functionality     : Deu2c is a great utility and has many more 
                          textures and things than Deu2!  It has been 
                          a great utility to make/edit Doom 2 levels!
