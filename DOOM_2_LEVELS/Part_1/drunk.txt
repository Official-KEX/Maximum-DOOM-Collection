Description: 

You and your buddies had a swell time, hanging out in various bars during a
stormy night. Then, suddenly you get warped by a weird thunderstorm to
a strange environment full of neato weapons... or something like that...
WHO CARES? Just take the weapons and have fun! (well, now the name has SOME
meaning *harhar*).

This is a DEATHMATCH-wad. This means that I didn't put in super-fancy
puzzles, keys or hard secrets. Those are mostly useless anyway, 'cos 
most players simply use cheats and editors when it gets too hard. Of course
I still added some neat stuff to enhance gameplay, but not too much to
obstruct some pleasant deathmatching (man, it's hard to find the
balance... I love beauty in simplicity though!)

DRUNK.WAD is the kind of deathmatch in which you have to SEARCH for your 
prey and HUNT it down. Of course there is enough chance to cause pure 
MAYHEM & DESTRUCTION! (esp. with 3-4 players).

ALL weapons are there, but the better they are, the harder they are to get
(you'll probably HATE my solutions for the BFG and the Plasma Rifle *grin*)
There are 7 deathmatch-spots with a shotgun nearby.

HAVE FUN!

                            guy can still accomplish something in life
                            (man, I feel much better now) ;-)

                          hit you severely with a weapon! The only remedy
                          is to hit right back... or run! Weird ha?

Authors may use this WAD-file to build their own level. On distributing, they 
should mention though that THIS is the WAD they built from.

Lately I have seen my WAD-files appear on CD's from companies I have never even
heard of. Even though I am flattered, I *hate* when this happens. So, if you 
want to use this WAD on a CD, you have to use an UNMODIFIED version, including 
this text-file. I'd also like to have a copy of the CD then.
