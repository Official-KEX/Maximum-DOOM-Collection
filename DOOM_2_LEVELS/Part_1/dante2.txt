			  And, of course, those guys at id.

Description             : DANTE'S GATE is the first level in my INFERNO series
			  and is fully compatible with DOOM ][.  I've added
			  monsters, weapons, and other goodies along the way.
			  The level has an entirely different look and feel.
			  For the most part, the only "theme" I had in mind was
			  to make the level as aesthetically pleasing and 
			  consistent as possible.  But there is a storyline:

			  After all this wackiness at the UAC base, you have
			  lost track of your lady-friend, BEATRICE.  How the
			  two of you ever got separated is no great mystery,
			  what with all these demons and devils running about, 
			  but you're damned if you're going to go through 
			  Hell for nothing.  The only other survivor besides
			  yourself and Beatrice is VIRGIL, the beatnik space
			  poet.  He last saw Beatrice by one of the warp-
			  gates.  Chances are she made it through -- but 
			  what's on the other side?

			  Only one way to find out.  You'll have to go 
			  through DANTE'S GATE.

Instructions		: Put DANTE2.WAD and DANTE2.BAT in your DOOM directory,
			  then type "DANTE2."   

Disclaimer		: I assume no responsibility for anything of any sort
			  in any way, shape, or form, now, then, henceforeward,
			  in this life (or the next several) for any screw-ups
			  or even minor inconveniences this PWAD causes you,
			  your family, your relatives, friends, ancestors,
			  associates, employers, pets, neighbors, lovers,
			  deities (major AND minor), nor any other person --
			  living, dead, or undead -- that you have or will ever
			  have any contact with in even the slightest form.
			  This PWAD has been tested and tested ad infinitum, so
			  it shouldn't mess with your computer or anything else
			  remotely associated with it.  But if it DOES, then
			  too damn bad.  Don't come cryin' to me.  It must be
			  something YOU did.

Grammar Lecture		: "a lot" is two words, not one; it's "you're," not
			  "your" -- as in "you are" unless you're (see?) using
			  the possessive in your (uh huh) text descriptions;
			  "their" indicates possession, "there" indicates
			  place or direction.
