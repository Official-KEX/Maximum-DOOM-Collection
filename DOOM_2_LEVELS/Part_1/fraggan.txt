Misc. Author Info       : Old fart playing with his wad. I like designing 
                          the arenas.
                          
* Play Information *

Game                    : DOOM II
Level #                 : MAP1
Single Player           : Yes, just to take a look...two mild monsters... 
Cooperative 2-4 Player  : What's the point?
Deathmatch 2-4 Player   : YES! Kill yer buddies...very nice 3 player and
                          hectic 4 player. It has a two person exit switch
                          to get final scores, by the candles in center
                          hallway. I designed this wad for maximum frag
                          frenzy, and supplied it amply with weapons and
                          armor/health.  This one makes frag kings of even 
                          the poorest players...
