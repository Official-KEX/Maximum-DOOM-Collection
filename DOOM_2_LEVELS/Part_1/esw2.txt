                          Hint : Don't give up looking for secrets...
                          there are many ! (specially in MAP07)
                          Hey man, come on, there is really no need to
                          cheat ! Besides it is YOU who wants to have  
                          fun playing this, don't you ?

                          This is the first pwad we did, so we would 
                          apreciate some feedback, e-mail me if you 
                          liked this pwad (or if you didn't).
                          More pwads will be done in future (including
                          HERETIC) depending on your suggestions...
