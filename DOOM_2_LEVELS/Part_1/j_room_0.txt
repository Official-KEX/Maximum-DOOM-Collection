J_ROOM_0.WAD - 2 new room-style levels for DOOM II DeathMatch
by Jordan Russell

This is a "pre-release" of a 6 level set I'm working on. I still haven't
finished aligning textures and fixing other minor bugs in levels 1 and 2 yet.

One of the changes you'll probably notice first is the sky. When you load
DOOM II with this WAD, the sky is changed to the sky used in DOOM I episode
1. I just can't stand playing with that depressing dark sky in DOOM II :)

= Level 1 =

Description:    This is a large dark room with many weird structures, a
                raiseable ledge surrounding the room, and an outside part.
                This was originally created using DEU and was made for
                DOOM I, but I converted it to DOOM II format and included
                it in this pack.
Level replaced: MAP01.
Meant for:      4 player DeathMatch.
Monsters:       Only there if you enable monsters and set skill to 4 or 5.
Time spent:     70+ hours.

= Level 2 =

Description:    This is similar to level 1 but smaller and brighter. You can
                easily get 15 frags or more in a few minutes with this one.
Level replaced: MAP02
Meant for:      3 or 4 player DeathMatch.
Monsters:       Only there if you enable monsters and set skill to 4 or 5.
Time spent:     20+ hours.
