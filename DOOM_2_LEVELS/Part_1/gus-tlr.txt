TLR : The Last Resort, the ultimate deathmatch experience,
 by M. Houston, G. Houston, A. Warrington, D. Sears.
If you don't know it then get it, it's great !
============================================================================

If you own a GUS with 1Mo on board and if you like playing TLR, 
THEN THIS IS FOR YOU !
This ZIP contains 2 WADS : 
   * GUSTLR1.WAD if you play TLR for DOOM (1)
   * GUSTLR2.WAD if you play TLR for DOOM ][
These WADS contain the entries DMXGUS for DOOM, DMXGUSC for DOOM ][, which
are the mappings of MIDI instruments for musics.
David Sears, the author of TLR's musics, has used a lot of instruments
that DOOM and DOOM ][ don't use. So it was essential to make a new mapping
for TLR, to appreciate to the full these very good musics.
Listen to the difference !

How to use it ?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Nothing's easier : 
  * copy GUSTLR1/2.wad in your TLR directory 
  * then : doom(2) -file tlr\gustlr1/2.wad tlr\last.wad tlr\resort.wad

or include it definitively in LAST.WAD or RESORT.WAD, thanks to DCK
or DEUTEX (very good tools, congratulations to authors !).

I hope you will like the new sound of TLR ...
