     >>> CYBRDTH2.WAD - A Doom2 Arena Style DeathMatch PWAD <<<

 This is rev "B" of CYBRDETH.WAD. Rev "A" added two Doom1 v1.666
compatible demos. This time around, it has been converted to the
Doom2 PWAD format. All three demos have been replaced. The first one
is a two player DeathMatch demo and is *very* fast paced... the last
two are just to show that the level can be completed in single play
on skill 3 and skill 4.  To watch the demos, simply load CYBRDTH2.WAD
into Doom2 and let the game sit for a few seconds and they will start
to play automatically.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
"Cyber Death [CYBRDTH2.WAD]" is an outdoor "arena" style
DeathMatch PWAD; DeathMatch on this level is intended to be played with
the-NOMONSTERS switch. The level has hidden teleporters & bonuses
placed specifically for DeathMatch, tons of large pillars scattered
randomly about, four weapon depots, and an open area in the middle
(where most of the fighting will probably occur).For single play, it
should be a true test of your Doom maneuverability skills because,
depending upon the skill setting, there are *numerous* CyberDemons and
limited ammo. There is *always* enough ammo to finish the Cybers, but
you will probably be forced to shotgun the last few.Hehe... If you can't
get 100% kills on skill 3, you're not worthy!! If you can get 100% kills
on skill 4, you can rest assured that you are one of the few. It's a
good way to practice for DeathMatches too, because it will force you to
conserve ammo and to take better [faster] aim, while perfecting
maneuvers like the COD. *PLUS* it should help some of you "CyberPhobic"
people get over your problem by making you face your fears.

 Some of you are saying "More than one CyberDemon!? That's just stupid!".
To that, I say: "You *wimps*... er... uh... I mean, try the level for
DeathMatch then; you'll never even have to see a CyberDemon". The reason
that I put so many Cybers in there for single play was to give myself a
warm up for DeathMatches and also because I find it somewhat entertaining
to go head-to-head with six CyberDemons (that's on skills 4 & 5, on skill
3 there are 3 Cybers, and on skills 1 & 2 there is only one Cyber, which
even my dog Fido can beat!). Your opinion on the entertainment value of
dancing with 6 CyberDemons may vary slightly from my own.

 For a hilarious & hair raising DeathMatch, try fighting your opponent
with a few Cybers strolling around the level (is it me, or do they always
seem to team up with the other guy!?).

 Some things that people have said while playing CYBRDETH.WAD:

 "OH @%&*!!"
 "Where in the %&*@ are all of the weapons!?"
 "Uh...why am I on the ground? The level just started!"
 "*WAY* to skimpy on the ammo!"
 "Did I  just get Teleporter Fragged?"
 "Victorious in battle, only to be pummeled to death at the end..."
 "I thought that I was good, but..."
 "Christ!! They're everywhere!"

                          best Doom shell there is, which also did
                          most of the conversion to the Doom2 PWAD
                          format, saving me some time!
                          I'd also like to thank all of the
                          people on ALT.DOOM.GAMES who were arguing
                          the best way to kill a single CyberDemon,
                          which is what gave me the idea for this
                          level. Try killing six, guys!
                          And let's not forget Steve; he's the green
                          guy in the first demo. Thanks for letting
                          me teleporter frag you, buddy!
