Description           : NOTE: Flight Technology included !!!!!!!!
                        This is my second attempt in creating a Deathmatch
                        wad. This wad is very small and was a quicky job,
                        so don't worry, my next wad (foxer3.wad) will be
                        much bigger. Enjoy, this wad will make you laugh
                        (and cry) as you fall to your death...

                        plain cool, Connor, aka. Rocket Man, Gamepal for
