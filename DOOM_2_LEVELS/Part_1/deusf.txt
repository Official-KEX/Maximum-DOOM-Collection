            DeuSF version 2.1	 10/94

Legal Stuff: see the end of this file.

  

**************** EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ******************

 DeuSF stands for DEU Sprite and Flats
 (DEU is a DOOM level editor by Bendon Wyber and Raphael Quinet.)
 (Heck, I know the DeuSF name is lame.)

 DeuSF is an alternative to DMADDS and DMADDF.

 DeuSF will enable you to distribute PWADS with only
 those SPRITES or FLATS that you wish to replace.

 To play you PWAD, people will have 3 solutions:
 - use DMADDS/DMADDF (do they still work?)
 - use DeuSF to regenerate another PWAD containing
   all the SPRITES and FLATS of DOOM which you can't
   distribute (illegal...and about 3 meg total :-)
 - use DeuTex (mergewad command) to merge the PWAD
  within their IWAD. This solution saves disk space,
  but modify the IWAD (though safely and reversibly).

 DeuSF will work with PWADs composed for DMADDS and
 probably DMADDF also.
 But DeuSF prefered PWAD composer is of course DeuTex.


************** Distribution *******************

 See legal stuff at the end.
 Basically, if you distribute for free, there is no restriction.

 DeuSF is derived directly from DeuTex, and edited
 for higher speed and smaller executable size. 
 

********************* THANKS **********************

DeuSF would not have existed without the help of those people:
	Bern Kreimeier		(bernd@nero.uni-bonn.de)
		(original DMADDS/DMADDF idea)
	Dewi Morgan		(D.Morgan@bradford.ac.uk)
		(unashamed flattery that lead me to consider
		 write DeuSF from DeuTex code)
 	Raphael Quinet 		(quinet@montefiore.ulg.ac.be)
		(for DEU code and general moral support)
 	Matt Fell 		(matt.burnet@acebbs.com)					
		(Doom specs version 1.3)
	ID software (help@idsoftware.com)
		(for the DeuSF test bench, also known as 'DOOM')

********************* SHAMES ***********************

DeuSF would not have existed if there was not a stupid bug
in the DOOM code for loading FLATS and SPRITES, that locks up
DOOM when you try to replace existing entries.

 
***************** CONVIVIALITY ************************ 

 DeuSF has NO human interface. I will seriously frown upon complaints
 about the lack of human interface. DeuSF IS MEAN TO BE RUN IN BATCH.

 You shall provide a batch file with all the PWADS you distribute.

 example:
 DeuSF -doom c:\doom -sprite -add ALIENGFX.WAD ALINGRFX.WAD
 
 
****************** DISCLAIMER ************************

	This program is an ordinary DOS executable, compiled in HUGE memory model,
	with 386 instructions. It might not run under a 286.

	Anyway, If all goes wrong I'll be very sorry but I will not 
	be liable for any damages consecutive to the use of this 
	program, including severe damage to your nerves or brain.
 

******************* Known problems **********************

-	DeuSF is not able to recognise SPRITES and FLATS just
		by the names in the PWAD directory.
		I refuse to program this because it would cause trouble
		if DOOM changes.
-	DeuSF was *not* tested under DOOM ][.
		There is no reason why it shouldn't work, but I would
		bet that damn program will find a bl**dy reason.
-	DeuSF will consider all the srites of DOOM. you cannot exclude
		some, i.e. to replace a one-viewpoint sprite by a 
		multi-viewpoint sprite, 0 terminated sprite must 
		be deleted. (this is for the future...)
-	Source is NOT included.
		not yet.

**************** Hardware Requirements **********************

 Compiled for 386. Does not make use of coporcessor.
 Should run with about 500k or less of free base memory.


********************  DeuSF Commands  ****************************



 All the optionnal commands must appear before the non optional ones
 else they will be ignored. (talk about commandline parsing!) 

* Help commands

DEUSF -help
	won't help you a lot, but will give you the parameters.
DEUSF -format
	will print the format of PWAD that DeuSF can recognise

* Optionnal commands

DEUSF  -doom <doom directory>
	OPTIONAL COMMAND
	DEFAULT IS: CURRENT DIRECTORY or \DOOM or \DOOM2
	use that command to indicate the directory where you put your DOOM.WAD and DOOM.EX
	example:        -doom C:\DOOM



DEUSF -sprite
DEUSF -flat
 	OPTIONAL COMMANDS
	to be use with -add, to add only sprites or only flats.
 
* Mandatory Commands

 
DEUSF -add  <myown.wad> <allsf.wad>

	Will put in ALLSF.WAD all the sprites and flats of DOOM.WAD
	together with those contained in MYOWN.WAD, provided they
	are recognised as SPRITES or FLATS.
	(S_START or SS_START,  F_START or FF_START are needed)

************** LAST WORDS   (AT LEAST!)  **************


Thanx for using DeuSF.

It's only a small derivative from my PWAD composer, DeuTex. 
If you enjoyed that program and want to create cool PWADS,
(and you're not too bored with my bugs) I'll suggest to
get hold of that DeuTex tool of mine.
