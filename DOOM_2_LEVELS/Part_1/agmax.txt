Description             : Like AG Assault, one guy on platform, 
                          other guy hides behind barriers, lotsa
                          weapons and stuff.  Nice cool music to
                          set the tone.  Sometimes both guys end
                          up on the same level.  This is really
                          fun - chasing the other guy around the
                          'arena', like a wild goose hunt. 
                          
                          TIP: click on that pillar on the top 
                          level... neato!  You really have to 
                          see what's in that neato pillar!

* How this WAD was made *

This level started off as a big room with a platform at one end.  
I added The thingy's in the middle when I thought to make it look 
like the American Gludiators Assault field.  I continued making 
improvements and changes to the level, including making it 
drastically smaller at one time.  Once the things were in place, 
I tested out my new Doom ][ editor by putting in all sorts of 
monsters.  Unfortunately, I saved over the wad without monsters -
and I'm too lazy to remove the monsters (that's why you use the 
-nomonsters switch for this level!).  I asked someone whether to 
make the wad for Doom I or Doom ][.  They said to make it for 
Doom ][.  So I redid all the textures with some thought in mind 
this time.  I added some super shotguns and put in the really cool 
stuff around the BFG (you know... in the column).  I then had to 
make the map MAP32, because I liked the music in that level. I 
would have been simple and plain and made the level MAP01, but 
I lack an editor to extract/import music for Doom ][.  P.S. If you 
think this level is any good, go to the #hockey on the irc and 
tell them to tell me that you think it's good.  :-]  By the way:  
my nick is MaCkS.
