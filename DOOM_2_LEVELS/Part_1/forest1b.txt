Description             : Three levels for the Forest BBS as a special
			  set for DOOM 2 !!

			  you have access to Multi-player DOOM!!!!!!

Additional Credits to   : Everyone; iD, DEU guys, blah blah
			  Oh, and the people I beat at the Christmas

			  everything!)

Known Bugs              : Mostly fixed, tell Smurf if there is anything

			  HINT: When playing 2-player serial link,
