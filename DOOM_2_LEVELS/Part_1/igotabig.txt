Description             : New map for DOOM II
                        :
                        : This level has been specifically designed for  
                          deathmatch(but one player to 
                          figure the level out).  A lot of secrets(especially
                          doors).  A few monsters to make it more 
                          interesting. There's a big outdoor room to fight 
                          in with windows to shoot out of all around.  Not
                          too big and just the right amount of ammo to kill.
                          If you find any mistakes e-mail me, this is my 
                          first post so tell me what you think!
