                          [DWANGO2.WAD]

It's BACK!  Here is another excellent collection of 11 SUPER levels
designed for 2-4 player deathmatch!  Also, new music and sound effects
have been added again.  These levels are a bit different than DWANGO1.WAD
in that these are larger, more complicated levels.

Once again, the music was picked to fit the mood of the level.

One interesting added sound which I created and I have placed in my
main DOOM2.WAD is the SPLAT sound (dsslop I believe is the location).
Anyway, it is from the end of my favorite music, Cliffhanger.  In case
you have a hard time understanding it, it goes:

"Season's over, *sshole!"

Map 01  BILL.WAD   -   This is a re-make of Map 01 with more ammo, a
                       megasphere, and dark halls that require the
                       light-amplification visor to see.

Map 02 RALPHII.WAD -   This is a unique level with a couple of courtyards
                       to duke it out. (From Map 3)

Map 03 RALPHII.WAD -   This is a complete revision of E1M1 from classic
                       Doom. (From Map 10)

Map 04 SLAPME2.WAD  -  A great medium-sized level that surrounds a main
                       courtyard w/ hallways and secret passages.

Map 05 TERROR.WAD   -  This is an arena-style level that resembles
                       Map 7 from Doom ][.

Map 06 COCHRAN.WAD  -  A great four-player level written by THE
                       Doomgod William Cochran.  Only ONE switch,
                       and ONE megasphere.  Plenty of weapons & ammo.

Map 07 DOOM.WAD     -  A revision of E2M8 from Classic Doom, if you
                       like rockets, this is YOUR level.  That's
                       ALL there is.

Map 08 D9-2.WAD     -  Fun large level w/ plenty of weapons and places
                       to hide. (From Map 1)

Map 09 RAVEN11.WAD  -  If you like MAP 13 from Doom ][, this one will
                       remind you a LOT of it.  A wonderful job of
                       a small town in the mountains.

Map 10 D9-2.WAD     -  A great larger arena style level that has a few
                       hidden and handy secret corridors to move you
                       around this level.

Map 11 RALPHII.WAD  -  Another larger yet playable level that is once
                       again great fun for four player. (From Map 6)
