Description             : Made with DEATHMATCH in mind...
                         Got kinda carried away with size, It would have
                         been larger but I seemed to have run out of 
                         conventional memory.Thats why the large east room
                         is incomplete, the goodies are there but the 
                         workers never finished unpacking the crates.
                         They've done a lot of overtime and they're not 
                         in a good mood,so be careful in there.
                         The game has been tested with a multiplayer
                         network, It's likely to be
                         a hard one on your own....
		
		UPGRADE! : VOID THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH!
		I got ahold of EDMAP and converted the place for 
		doom II. It is now virtually impossible in
		single play mode. I never did finish that east wing...
                BONUS!!! I threw in a modified e1m1 from doom 1 
		upgraded for DOOM II!!
