Misc. Author Info       : my name is Andrew, and I'm a Doomaholic

Description             : Yet another deathmatch WAD but only for DooM II. I tried to make this work as a small single player level aswell. Watch out when you go for the plasma gun, you might get trapped. I deceided to include the BFG this time to give your opponent maximum grief.

Additional Credits to   : They know who they are and they should know better by now.
