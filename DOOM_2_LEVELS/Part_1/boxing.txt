Description             : This wad really isn' a big deal. I pretty much
                          just made it for fun. Dont expect alot of replay
                          value from this one. (sorry) But I do hope you
                          enjoy it all the same! OK heres the description,
                          This is a Deathmatch boxing game (please no guns
                          allowed) You can either duke it out or have a
                          chainsaw match! And please don't disturbe the
                          spectators, as they have only come to see the
                          match and you could instigate a riot!
