Description             : This level is designed to be a fast paced 
			  deathmatch level with a Doom ][ feel.
			  The only obsticals in the level are the weapons.
			  All weapons are present, but each weapon has a   
			  certain degree of consequence.  The plasma being
			  one of the favorite weapons has the largest
			  consequence, that being every one knows where you
			  are when you get it.  Since the Super Shotgun has
			  become such a farorite weapon in deathmatch, that  
			  also has a slight degree of consequence.  This 
			  level is great for two players, but the more
			  the merrier.

Org Description         : This level is best played with -altdeath and
			  nomonsters, but if you must, I threw in a few
			  baddies to make it interesting.  I didn't put in
			  4 player starting points so co-op is definitely
			  out of the question.  If you really must play 
			  with monsters present I recommend playing Hurt Me
			  Plenty on -respawn. It's just enough to aggravate 
			  you, and supply a little ammo in the proccess.

P.S.  This level is living proof that you can design a level with something
other than DEU.  
				
P.S.S.  I have yet to find one decent editor (that works). Renegade DoomED
is the best when it comes to editing a map. You can edit lindefs, sidedefs,
floor & ceiling graghics, and sector hights & light values all at once!  But
they have yet to fix their map editor. :(  The sucky part is is that
DEU works, but the format is lowsy! :( My eyes can only take so much when 
it comes to the WHOLE screen redrawing itself a million times while moving 
a line...AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
