Misc. Author Info       : 1st serious Deathmatch wad. I've taken a little of
                          what I liked in many deathmatch wads and implemented
                          them in this wad.

Description             : This is a DOOM II-only deathmatch wad.
                          If you like the arena type deathmatch wad, then
                          you'll like this one. I've spent alot of time making
                          sure the textures line up, that doors aren't chopped
                          in half, and you don't see the tootie-fruity effect
                          all over the place. There nothing more irritating
                          than these people who publish wads with basically
                          good structural ideas, but with crappy looking
                          texture alignments.
                          There are plenty of secret areas and sniper points.
                          However, watch your back! There is almost no place
                          you can go where someone can't sneak up behind you.
                          Have fun. I hope you enjoy it and much as I did
                          making it.

                          wad and being rather ruthless playtesters.
