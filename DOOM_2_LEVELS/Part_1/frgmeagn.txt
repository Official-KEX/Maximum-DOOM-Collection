Misc. Author Info       : Just another chemistry graduate student
                          that loves to play doom.
Description             : This DOOM II pwad was designed specifically 
                          with 2-player Deathmatch 2.0 in mind and
                          is the sequel to FRAGME.WAD.  It should 
                          play pretty well in single player mode
                          also (ultraviolence).  Skill levels are
                          fully implemented for those with different
                          deathmatch tastes.  This level has a
                          cooperative exit, so you must cheat in 
                          single player mode to finish.

***Notes on Difficulty Settings***

Skills 1 and 2:
        Contains all of the weapons except the BFG and no soul
        spheres or megaspheres.  Just enough monsters to keep 
        things interesting.  Great with -altdeath and -respawn.
        Much too easy for single player mode.

Skill 3:
        Same as skills 1 and 2, except with a few more monsters
        and maybe some health and ammo changes.  This dificulty
        setting has a megasphere and a BFG for those of you that
        like these items in deathmatch.  Should also be good with
        -altdeath and -respawn.  Probably too easy for single
        player.

skill 4:
        This difficulty separates the men from the boys.  
        Weapons are the same as Skills 1 and 2, but the amount
        and difficulty of monsters has been greatly increased.
        There is also less health and ammo (single player), and
        no BFG or soul spheres (etc.).  Should play well in 
        single player mode and -respawn in deathmatch would
        be a bloodbath.  :)
