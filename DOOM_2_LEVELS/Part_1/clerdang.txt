Misc. Author Info       : I used to run Game Palace bbs
Description             : This level is DEATHMATCH oriented with lots of
                          weapons and health.  Perfect size for non-stop
                          fragging action!
                          I have added a deliberate and obvious exit to this
                          level to prevent any arguing over who had how many
                          frags.  The exit is clearly marked, so don't exit
                          unless everyone is ready!
