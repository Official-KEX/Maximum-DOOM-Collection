Title                   :Kick an imp and he gets pissed!
Filename                : AKQ5.WAD & Dehacked patch AKQ.DEH
Author                  : Paul Noble
Email Address           : editor@elbon.demon.co.uk
Misc. Author Info       : Creator of the Akm series of wads of 
			which two updated levels are available 
			at ftp.cdrom.com. The others must be 
			requested.

Description             : This is a little level which I made 
			soon after my first couple of deathmatches
			it originally was intended to mimic the 
			mood and feel of the first doom2 level,
			but soon after putting half of it down on
			paper, I had a stunning idea, although
			it will hoepfully be good for deathmatch
			it also has a severe sting in the tail for
			single and coop play. I do not advise coop
			play as there is really only enough ammo
			for 1 player and 4 deathmatchers, even then
			the DMers may come up short. The Dehacked patch
			is essential for play as single play and coop.
			It's not so important for DM but it will be
			annoying for them if the patch isn't implimented.

Additional Credits to   : Thanks to Ben Morris who made it possible
			with dck 2.2 to finish this level in under 3
			hours. Also big thanks to the Dehacked author.
			Tar youz for trying this level.
