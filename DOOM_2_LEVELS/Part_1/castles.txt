Doom2 - (Multi-1)

   This is my first Multi-Player only Pwad (more to come). I feel that a 
single player Pwad is just that, and a multi-player Pwad should be designed 
differently. The over all set up is two castles (fortifications) that each 
player can control. 

   The castles each have a switch to raise or lower its protective barrier. 
There is also a walkway which connects the two which can be controlled by 
both players. Their are also switches which control the ability of either 
player to access the BFG9000.

   I also have set up smaller weapon/ammo fortifications which house the 
chain-gun and the double barrell shotgun, plus the ammo for these.

   The third and final area is the Pit. The pit contains the health, Rocket 
Launcher and Plasma Rifle. This is a powerful area. He who controls the pit, 
conmtrols the game (in most cases).

   I have set up most of the walls to be one way. You can see in but you 
can't see out. You can walk through both directions. This creates some very      
interesting battles.

   Both players should become familiar with the layout, and then may the best 
player win.

   If you do not have a loader that runs Pwad files then you will run this
right from the DOS prompt. I will give a short example of what to type but I
recommend reading up on the line parameters so ti suits your tastes. Both 
must have the Pwad installed on their system for this to run correctly.

   Example.
      sersetup -dial Tel.# -file castles.wad -deathmatch -altdeath -14400

      If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions - Please leave me a 
message on the B.B.S. you dowloaded this from. 

                                        Have Fun.
