Description             : D9-2-2! Well its finally here, the last 3 levels
                          of the D9 series for Doom2!  If I do say so myself
                          these 3 levels are the finest of the series, and
                          complete the 10 level mini episode I have been
                          working on!  A must have for any D9 fan!  I have
                          included two handy batch files to load all 10
                          exciting levels when you play.  I decided not to
                          group them to save you download time and money.
                          These replace levels 8 through 10, and I'm sure
                          you'll enjoy them.  Have fun!!
