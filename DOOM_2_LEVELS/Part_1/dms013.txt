Title                   : Doom Mouse Spinner (DMS) v0.12 beta

Filename                : DMS.COM
Authors                 : Tom Klok and Dave 'Zoid' Kirsch
Email Address           : a344@mindlink.bc.ca

Description             : Ever had the problem of a monster or
                          deathmatch opponent sneaking up behind
                          you?  Ever needed to turn around *now*?
                          With DMS, you can rotate your player
                          180 degrees with a click of the mouse!

Release note            : This is a *BETA* release.  DMS has been
                          tested with Logitech 3-button and
                          Microsoft 2-button mice.  It should work
                          with others without problems.  I don't
                          know what it would do with a CyberMan.

Release note for DMS v0.13   
                        : Modified by Lincoln Yeoh so you can use a 
                          user definable key on the keyboard to flip!
                          And added -n for people who don't want to use                                            
                          the mouse buttons to flip.

                          Seems to work. If it doesn't. Tough! Go fix it.

What it is
~~~~~~~~~~

     DMS is a tiny TSR (443 bytes resident) that intercepts Doom's
calls to the mouse driver.  By clicking the mouse buttons that you
define, it will instantly turn you 180 degrees -- facing the exact
opposite direction.  Cranking up your mouse driver sensitivity can
allow you to do the same, but then your accuracy may fall off.
With this you don't have to make that compromise.

     It supports mouse "chords".  For example, if you have a 2-button
mouse you can set it up to spin you only when you press the left and
right mouse button at the same time.  3-button mice permit even more
combinations.  I prefer the Middle+Right button chord on my Logitech.

LY> I prefer to flip with the keyboard, and leave the mouse buttons
    for other stuff. That explains this patch :-). This makes it easier
    to run forward, flip, run backward facing opponent, aim, fire, flip
    back again to see where you're going. Also convenient if you back into
    a door- flip, press spacebar..

Does it work for Deathmatch?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Sure, why not?  It shouldn't cause consistency failure.  Some
might consider it cheating, though.

LY>     I think Heretic has this function built in. And I think adding
        the keyboard support makes it a bit more fair now... 
        Mouse AND Keyboard is still better!

How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Doom uses two standard Mouse API services:

          function AX=0003h             - mouse button status
          function AX=000Bh             - mouse delta mickey counts

     A 'mickey' is the smallest unit of mouse movement... sort of like
a pixel on the screen.  Every time Doom requests the new delta mickey
counts, the mouse driver returns the number of mickeys (X and Y,
positive and negative) the mouse has moved since the last request.

     DMS hooks interrupt 33h, the mouse driver interrupt, and watches
for those two function requests.  Whenever Doom asks for the latest
button status, DMS passes the request on to the mouse driver and then
checks to see if the special button(s) have been pressed.  If they
have, it masks them out (tells Doom they never happened) and adds 180
degrees to the X-axis mickeys the next time Doom asks for them.
     DMS 0.13 does that too, and also checks the keyboard- in al,060h

     DMS was written in assembly language for small size.  Source code
is included.


How to install it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Put DMS013.COM in your Doom directory, or some other directory in your
DOS path.  Simply type 'DMS013' to load it.  Be sure you load it AFTER your
mouse driver, not before, or it won't work.  <-- Important!

     'dms -?' or 'dms -h' will display some simple usage help.  To
configure your own button preferences, run DMS with a parameter
indicating which buttons you want.  The default is the right mouse
button.  For example, if you prefer the Left+Right buttons to spin
you, enter 'dms -lr'.  Since I like Middle and Right, I use 'dms -mr'.

     You can change your button definitions by running DMS again.  It
will detect that it is already loaded and just update the buttons.

     DMS may be loaded into conventional memory, or high memory (UMB's).
There really isn't any point in loading it high, however, as Doom doesn't
need much conventional memory and DMS only consumes 384 bytes resident.

     Make sure you maximize the mouse sensitivity setting in Doom.
Anything less than full sensitivity will mean you'll turn less than 180
degrees.
     
     ENSURE that you have set your controller type to Keyboard and Mouse 
     in your DOOM config setup. Even if you are just using the keyboard
     you need the mouse driver and mouse enabled under DOOM for it to work!
     It should work with controller type set to just plain Mouse... 
     But that's a weird thing to do!
                                       

How to uninstall it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     DMS doesn't include software to release itself.  Sorry.  Go
download the MARK/RELEASE tools, or just reboot after you're done.

I did try to email Tom and Dave a copy, but their email addresses don't seem
to work anymore. Anyone know their email addresses?

Thanks to you two anyway. Nice code - finally some PC code that even I can
decipher!

Thinking of adding auxiliary keys/button for forward and backwards. Nah,
DOOM isn't a flight simulator!! :-).

 Typing DMS013 by itself doesn't seem to select right button by default.
 Can't be bothered to fix that!
