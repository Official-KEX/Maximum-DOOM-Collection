Description             :This wad was first made for Doom but then DoomII
                         came out. I got the wad changer which switches Doom
                         wads into DoomII wads. Then I changed most things 
                         and textures.
                           
                         This is a 3 level episode designed for multiplayer
                         (either DM or Cooperative). The end level has Bosses
                         so be prepared.PLEASE E-MAIL ME ON IF YOU THINK
                         IT IS A GOOD DEATHMATCH WAD

                         I made a deathmatch demo with my friend on this wad.
                         Watch this and see what it is like if you do not play
                         deathmatch. I think that you should all take a look at
                         this.It is really cool.
                         To play this demo go into the doom2 directory and type
                         demo. I made a .bat file to make it easier

                         Also to all the programs I used to make these levels
