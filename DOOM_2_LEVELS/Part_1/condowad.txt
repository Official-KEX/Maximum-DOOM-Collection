Description             : A compact, fast-action deathmatch wad.
                          Good ambush and sniping spots, but don't
                          stay in one spot too long.  This is a frag-
                          a-second style wad.  With 4 players on a net
                          you will always be fragged or fraggin'someone.
                          Not much "dead" time..ha ha ..

Additional Credits to   : All those fabulous people at Id who made this
