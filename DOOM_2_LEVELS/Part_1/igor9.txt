* Important Notes *

        Igor is an attempt to provide for as many different Deathmatch tastes 
as possible, as each level contains a different environment in which to play. 
You can play all of the levels sequentially or, if you only like a certain 
level, you can play that one alone.  I've included support for various modes 
of play as follows:
        
        1.  Original Deathmatch rules ("I'm Too Young To Die" and "Hey, Not 
            Too Rough" support this) 
            
        2.  Deathmatch 2.0 rules ("Hurt Me Plenty" supports this) 
        
        3.  What I call "Expert" mode ("Ultraviolent" supports this)  
        
Original Deathmatch and Deathmatch 2.0 are basically the same setup with 
minor variations in ammo/health placement.  Expert mode has very little 
health and ammo, but DOES include almost every weapon per level (including 
the BFG).  Use Expert mode if you play such an intense Deathmatch game that 
you don't stay alive very long (i.e. three- or four-player Deathmatch games 
over a LAN or MPGS).
        I've also included monster support - monsters are placed 
strategically to add spice to the game.  Usually players don't need this in
a three- or four-player game, but sometimes a two-person game can get a 
little slow.  Either way you like it, BE SURE TO INCLUDE THE RESPAWN OPTION
WHEN USING MONSTERS in your Deathmatches.
        Also note that most of the levels involve a cooperative exit.  If an 
exit door doesn't open when you hit the switch, you may have to ask your 
friend(s) for help.  Make SURE you're ready to leave when you hit an exit 
button.
        Please take a walk through these levels before you actually use them
in Deathmatch.  While each is extremely straightforward, it's always nice to
get a feel for a new level before you begin.  I'm open to any comments/  
suggestions you may have, so please send me email!
        Finally, if anyone uses this pwad who plays over a LAN (with three 
or four people), please make an LMP file and send it to me!  I've rarely had
the chance to see more than two people in these levels, and would like to 
see the action.  Thanks for using Igor!
