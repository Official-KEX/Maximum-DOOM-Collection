  Ready for the best deathmatch level out there?  Tired of never having a gun
becuase of altdeath?  Here is your solution.  This is a relatively small 
level made primarily for teams deathmatch, but also is great for one on one
deathmatch as well.  There are six deathmatch starts in the entire level.  
Each has a room that is not connected to the main level that has the three
primary weapons (super shotgun, rocket, chaingun).  The rooms also have 
2-4 teleporters to teleport into the actual level.  There are only 4 tele-
port exits in the level.  So get to know which ones go where.  There is only
one megasphere in the entire level.  To get to it you have to hit a switch
to lower the lifts.  That is the only switch in the level, so if you hear it
you know where they are heading!  There is also the "Black Fort" at the end.
If you think you can hold it against your buddies, just try!  This level 
was made for deathmatch by me (William Cochran), the current and undefeated
DOOM GOD.  Have fun and enjoy!

                                            aka DOOM GOD

P.S. - If you can make it through this level without dying (one player),
       you must be a DOOM GOD.  I can make it 2 out of 3 times!  It is 
       possible, just really really hard.
