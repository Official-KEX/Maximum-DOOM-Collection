Title                   : HELLYEAH!
Author                  : Will Pendleton
Other Files By Author   : None really...first *REAL* wad..
Misc. Author Info       : Be ready for my next wad!

Description             : Level 1: This is an edited level 1..This still has
                          the feeling of level 1 too..
                          Level 2: This level is probably my favorite...Its
                          not too big, not too small..It even looks good..
                          Level 3: This is a small, quick frag level..There
                          are a few secrets to it...try and find em..
                          Level 4: This is a wad a friend made...I did the 
                          textures though..Be careful that if you hit the 
                          light switch, that you can find your way back..
                          Level 5: This is my first level ever made..
                          (ROOSTER.WAD) i went and added a few more stuff.
                          basically cleaned it up..
                          Level 6: This level is made for 4 player..it can 
                          be played with 2 players, but its a little too wide
                          open...
                          Level 7:Ryan made this level..its his first attempt
                          at a wad...he did pretty good....I helped out with
                          some of the textures though..
