Completion date:  February 8, 1995
Completion time:  10 hours (gimme a break, it's my first one!)
Tools used:  Doomcad5.1 for Windows, AMD 486DX2/80
Needed:  Registered version of Doom2 (v 1.666 or above)
Replaces:  Map 01                                   

This pwad supports single player, 2-player modem, and 2 thru 4 player network
play (co-op and deathmatch).  Start out on map 01 to play this level.  This is
my first distribution and attempt at creating a DoomII level.

This level can be played as a single level only, but it was really meant for
2 to 4 player deathmatch.  It's alot more fun that way!

The setting is 75% out in the open, however, there are a few passage ways
outside of the large open area.  A few secret places, but no official 
secrets where you get credit for them.

Give me some feedback and let me know what you think!

Happy Dooming!
