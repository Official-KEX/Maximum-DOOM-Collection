Misc Author Info        : about 6'5" 230lbs. cut like granite.  
                          (if you believe this, I'd like to sell you the
                           rights to this great game, I call it Doom.)

Description             : This is a WAD for Doom II that can be used for 
                          either single-player, cooperative, or deathmatch
                          play. There are three "worlds," if you will, 
                          (earth, fire, and water) that you must fight
                          through to get to the exit.  It's pretty straight-
                          forward. 

Credits                 : Thanx to all my deathmatch buddies for dying so
                          well when testing this level.  Thanx to the 
                          creators of Edmap and DEU for making such great
                          editors.  And last but not least those incredible
                          guys at ID for taking my life away from me.
