Description             : This level was designed to be used in deathmatch
                          mode mainly, but I did throw a few monsters in to
                          allow a user to lump up someone other then a 
                          human opponent. This WAD has some real nice 
                          defense features that I have not seen in any
                          other WAD to date.

Misc Game Info          : DOOM II WAD. This WAD is error free. It's been play
                          tested for over 20 hours. It should run fine on a
                          386 or a 486. It's been played on both.

Additional Credits to   : Special thanks goes to GUNSLINGER for all the play
                          testing and help with new ideas to make the WAD
                          what it is. Thanks to CHAPMAN & SLUGO for playtest-
                          ing development.
