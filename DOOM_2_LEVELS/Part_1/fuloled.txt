Misc. Author Info       : I'm a student at the University of Mississippi,
                          currently majoring in Computer Science.  I
                          welcome E-mail of any kind, so drop me a line
                          and tell me what you liked, or what you didn't
                          like, or what you thought sucked royally.

                          (P.S. I would absolutely love to see a *.lmp
                          of a game played on this level, especially if
                          it is a 3 or 4 player game!  Please! Please! <g>)

Description             : This is a DEATHMATCH-ONLY pwad for DOOM ][.
                          SIGH!!! ANOTHER ONE?  Yes, but I think this
                          one will be worth your download.  First of
                          all, it contains NO MEGASPHERES OR SUPERCHARGES!
                          so the game does not turn into HealthWars.
                          There is a strategically placed medkit and
                          beserk pack, along with a few stimpacks. There
                          are plenty of weapons to prevent anyone from
                          gaurding them all. I've tried to make this
                          level a very playable deathmatch design.  All
                          weapons are present, except the BFG.  (I rarely
                          like the BFG for deathmatch games, except when it
                          is strategically placed (such as in DANZIG13.WAD). 
                          I've added a few features to this level which, in
                          my opinion, sets it apart from most deathmatch
                          levels currently available:

 1. Although the plasma gun is available, it rests on a platform that must
    be dropped by a remote switch, which also drops a lift elsewhere in the
    level that contains a beserk pack.  This makes getting the plasma gun a
    risky venture.  Also, there are no energy cells lying around, so you'd
    better make that ammo count.

 2. One of the metal pillars in the inside room has a walk-thru linedef on
    the west side. This allows players to enter the pillar and ambush their
    opponent, or hide from them when they get low on health.

 3. There are several sniper positions from which you can frag your buddy,
    and I've tried to make the level a very "open" one, so most of the time
    you have a pretty good idea of where your opponent is.

 4. There is a medium-sized semicircular courtyard for those plasma and
    rocket battles.  A small bunker in the courtyard has a chaingun and
    a spy hole that is aimed towards the door of the courtyard.

 5. Stepping over the rocket-launcher platform in one of the courtyard
    buildings triggers several lifts throughout the sector to fall,
    which gives away your position to your enemy.

 6. This level contains a cooperative exit to prevent one player from
    exiting when the other isn't ready.

Additional Credits to   : ID, of course, for making the best two-player
                          game ever.

                          To the creators of the IGOR and DANZIG death-
                          match levels.  Those guys are absoluted GODS
                          when it comes to making an awesome PLAYABLE
                          deathmatch level.  I'd especially welcome
                          any E-mail from you guys.
