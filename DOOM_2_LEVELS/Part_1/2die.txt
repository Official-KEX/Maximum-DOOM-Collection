Description             : An incredible 2 player deathmatch wad!
                          If you like a great 3D layout and 
                          architecture, this level is for you.
                          Extensively playtested in both 2 and
                          3 player mode.  Also, supports single
                          and cooperative play!

Additional Description:  In a 2 player game we were getting a frag 
every 30 seconds!  A 3 (or heaven forbid-- 4) player game is
pure chaos!  I spent a *lot* of time on the design and layout of 
this level.  It's designed for deathmatch but single player is a
real challenge!

Check out the included demo to see how good this level plays.  I 
have other incredible demos of this level.  On one demo, I BFG Mike W.
in mid-air as he leaps for the plasma rifle-- you've got to see it
to believe it!  Email me and I'll sent it to you.

Please, email me with your comments if you like this wad.  Also,
please send me your best demos of this level!
