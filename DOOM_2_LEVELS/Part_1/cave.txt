I would like to thank the makers of Deu for making such a wonderful
editor.  Without it almost all PWads would not be in existance.

I would most like to thank the makers of Deu text 1-4.  Without them
this level or any level I make in the future would not have been
possible without it, thanks Blackfist!!
