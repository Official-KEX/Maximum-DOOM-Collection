INTRODUCTION

Don't you just hate it when some guy with no life who all he does is play
Heretic on his computer challenges you to a game of Heretic?  "Ahh, c'mon!
I'll play easy on ya!  It'll be fun!".  Well, I don't know because I'm the
one killing, maiming, and just bustin' heads in general.  I've been beat 
really hard at games such as Street Fighter II because I wasn't some expert
on the subject.  Well, time for revenge!  Read this, practice, pump up and
challenge that sucker to "one last game".  Remember the ad where a guy and
his girl are at the beach and some big jerk kicks sand in his face and takes
the guy's girl?  Well, you can be just like that ad.  Have fun!


DRIVE-BY EGGINGS

The Yoke's On You
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
This is a little fun trick that involves an egg and a crossbow or a phoenix
rod.  Get an egg, and one of the above weapons.  Seek out your opponent.
As soon as you see him, fire the egg, and before the egg hits, also fire your
weapon (the crossbow rocks when powered up).  He won't be able to do anything
because as soon as he's turned into a chicken, he only has 30 health, and
he can't use his tome of power in time if he gets hit with a shot right after
he gets turned into a chicken.  This is the most fun when he has a good 
weapon that he was bragging about having.

Goo Goo Ga Joob  
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Here's how to protect yourself from the above attack.  Keep two things in
mind:  You're hard to egg or hit with any other weapon when you're running
or flying, and a spell book will "unegg" you.  Usually an opponent only
has one egg at a time since they are usually hard to get, or there is only
one of them per level.  Always be moving fast when playing DeathMatch.  Only
slow down to pick up items if you miss them while running or to manuver
through tight and dangerous spots.  Even though an egg shoots many eggs at
a time, if you are gone by the time the egg hits where it was aimed, the egg
doesn't do much good.  Also, when you see an egg coming, move even if you
will get hit by the egg (for this it's always handy to have a few spell books
on hand).  If you get hit by the egg when you're running, chances are that
you won't be hit by a shot if the opponent uses the above tactic (the yoke's
on you).  If you get egged, press the backspace key immediatly.  If you have
a spell book, you will be turned back to your normal state, then if you have
another spell book or egg or both, use them to wipe out your enemy.

IT'S A BIRD!  IT'S A PLANE!  IT'S... SUPERWIZARD?

Hey, Mac!  Look Up!
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
There are various things you can do from the air.  One of the best things is
a variation on the "The Yoke's On You" tactic.  Try it from the air!  To 
be most effective though, be looking at the ground.  Another good air trick
is strafing, especially with a powered up weapon!  This works best with a 
rapid fire weapon such as a dragon claw, a hellstaff, or a firemace.  It also
works well with a phoenix rod or a powered-up crossbow.  Look down at the 
sucker and hold down the fire button.  Swoop down by using the insert key
or whatever key makes you go down, and the fire key, and if you can, the
shift key all at the same time.  Don't go down too low though, or he will
be able to hit you more easily.  After you made your attack, glide back up.
If your enemy isn't dead yet, circle around for another attack.  He'll never
know what hit him!

It's Amazing How Few People Look Up When They Go Into A Closet
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
This is especially true in Heretic, Since the look up/down keys are somewhat
out of the way of the other controls.  This also works the best in a dark 
room.  Here's what to do:  Fly into a corner of a room that has some good
items or weapons that your opponent frequently visits.  Hide in the side of 
the room where the doors are, a good place being just above the door (make
sure your feet don't dangle down).  Right when he gets the item, fire with
any weapon but the elvenwand, staff or gloves.  If he escapes, chase after 
him in the air!

MAKE LIKE RAMBO AND BLOW HIS SORRY A** INTO OBLIVION

It's Raining Cats And Dogs
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Actually, it's raining fire and acid when you use the hellstaff when you're
powered up.  This is a little fun trick to use when your enemy is hiding 
behind somthing, with no roof (or even with a roof).  This also works really
well when flying.  So you don't wanna come out, eh?  Power up your hellstaff
and fire a few shots against the wall where he is.  You're hear things like:
"Haha, missed me...Uh oh!  AAAAAAAARRRRRGGGHHHH!".  Whee!  Fun!

How D'Ya Like Yer Ribs?
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
There is nothing more freaky in Heretic than being chased by a psycho with 
a flame thrower (a phoenix rod when powered up).  The flame thrower spews
a fiery strem (needless to say) or fire.  Every split second that you get 
touched with this takes away from your health.  Try to corner him so that
you can close in on him.  Watch his body burn a twist like a wax doll on 
fire.  Have fun!  

The Elvenwand Is Back For Vengence!
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
I have killed many unsuspecting foes with just an elvenwand...that's powered
up.  When powered up, this wimpy little wand shoots double and causes major
damage.  Be careful though, and dodge around a lot.

Teleporting Trama
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
The firemace makes a handy weapon...Especially when it's powered up to the 
max!  The firemace when powered up can even go through teleports!  So that
guy that ran away through that teleport thinks he's safe, does he?  DOES HE?!
Fire a few shots through and then jump through yourself to finish him off.

MIND GAMES

Lookin' For This?
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Hide out where a good weapon is (a place that your enemy knows about and is
bound to visit), and make sure he doesn't have it first (even if he does,
this is fun).  When he walks in the door looking for the weapon that greedy 
old you took, let him look until he notices you.  Then waste him.

I'm Sooo Scared
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
So he thinks he's tough with that elvenwand does he?  If he starts shooting
you with an elvenwand, run like he's about to kill you and you don't have any
weapons.  Then go to a dead end, turn around with a better weapon, and fry 
his little rear.  Even more fun, let him chase you to where a better weapon
is, and get it.  Make sure he sees you get it.  Then when he starts to run,
chase him and fire tons of shots.  This can also be used in reverse, by you
shooting at him with an elvenwand and then switching to a true butt-kickin'
weapon.

Those were a few neat tricks to help waste your opponent with.  This list will
be updated.

A BETTER MANUAL

Face it, the manual that comes with Heretic isn't to hot, and a manual doesn't
even come with the Shareware version!  Well, here it is:  The NEW Heretic
Manual.

The Weapons
-=-=-=-=-=-
The Staff and the Gauntlets
KEY: 1
STATUS: Staff-Non-Magical Gauntlets-Magical  
The Staff is a stupid little stick.  It's worthless!  When it's powered up,
then it might do some damage.  Maybe.  The Gauntlets are a bit stronger.
If your enemy has an elvenwand, then charge with the gauntlets.

Elvenwand
KEY: 2
STATUS: Magical
This is the default weapon.  Get a better one!  When powered up, it shoots
a double blast and causes extra damage.

Crossbow
KEY: 3
STATUS: Magical
This is your basic weapon.  If you only have an elvenwand, get this to blow
your enemy to ashes.  When powered up, it blasts 5 shots instead of 3 to 
really blast your opponent.

Dragon's Claw
KEY: 4
STATUS: Magical
This weapon has the advantage of being rapid fire.  Unfortunately, it doesn't
do much damage and wastes a lot of ammo.  When powered up, the claw blasts
in four directions.

Hellstaff
KEY: 5
STATUS: Magical
Oooh, now we get to the heavy stuff!  This thing shoots rapid fire blasts
that cause major damage!  When powered up, it fires slow, but when it hits,
it starts to rain acid and fire (depending on which color you are).

Phoenix Rod
KEY: 6
STATUS: Magical
Basically a rocket launcher, this not only is very powerful, but it has a 
blast radius that also can be lethal.  When powered up, it turns into a
flame thrower to toast your opponent.  If you have an egg, you can have
fried chicken for dinner!

Firemace
KEY: 7
STATUS: Non-Magical
This weapon is hard to dodge!  It fires bouncing balls that bounce once and
then blow up.  It has a very high fire rate.  When powered up, the balls
are huge, bounce as many times as they want (until they hit a door or wall),
even through teleports!
