Description            : DEATHMATCH EPISODE
                         Made for when Stefan and I only had 386's, so as a
                         result most levels are very small. We have since
                         upgraded, but still play them as they are real good
                         for massive amounts of combat.
                         There is also an excessive amount of monsters, on
                         some levels, the idea there was to off set any 
                         advantage with weapons across each level.
                         With a choice of exit, the left is always the secret.

Additional Credits to  : id for um something...
                         Stefan Seager, Henry Knowles, Stephen Bacon,
                         Brent McClintock, Simon Peterson for playtesting.
